# Breadcrumbs Component

Breadcrumbs provide navigation context by showing the user's current location within the site hierarchy.

import Breadcrumbs from '@components/Breadcrumbs/index.astro'

## Basic Breadcrumbs

<Breadcrumbs path="/articles/my-article" pageTitle="My Article" />

## Deep Navigation

<Breadcrumbs path="/services/web-development/frontend" pageTitle="Frontend Development" />

## Case Study Breadcrumbs

<Breadcrumbs path="/case-studies/ecommerce-redesign" pageTitle="E-commerce Platform Redesign" />

## Usage

The Breadcrumbs component automatically generates breadcrumb navigation based on the current page path and optional page title.

```astro
---
import Breadcrumbs from '@components/Breadcrumbs/index.astro'
---

<Breadcrumbs path={Astro.url.pathname} pageTitle="Current Page" />
```
