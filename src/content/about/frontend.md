I've had a long journey client side, starting with EmberJS and JQuery. These days I focus on React, vanilla CRA, and the frameworks that have grown up around it - NextJS, Gatsby, Redwood, and the headless CMS platforms like Sanity and Contentful. I have a fairly deep knowledge of browser native APIs, the browser rendering pipeline, and CSS3. I'm competent with a variety of styling systems, including design tokens, SASS, CSS-in-JS, BEM, and Tailwind.

I have a strong interest in accessibility on the front-end, as a family member of mine is visually impaired. I hope to make the web a little better place by helping users with disabilities achieve their potential and to help ensure the accessibility of software products to end users with disabilities. I'm multi-lingual, culturally sensitive, and take internationalization seriously for projects that require it. I've been active on the W3C's schemaorg mailing list for close to a decade and have strong experience with semantic markup.
