## Real-World Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Healthcare Provider Recovery

**Scenario**: 200-bed hospital hit with Ryuk ransomware affecting electronic health records.

**Response**:

- Activated paper-based backup procedures
- Isolated infected systems within 2 hours
- Restored critical systems from backups
- Full recovery achieved in 72 hours

**Lessons Learned**:

- Importance of offline backup systems
- Value of regular disaster recovery drills
- Need for alternative operational procedures

**Cost**: $150K in recovery costs vs. $2M ransom demand

### Case Study 2: Manufacturing Company Prevention

**Scenario**: Attempted WannaCry infection blocked by security controls.

**Prevention Measures**:

- Network segmentation prevented spread
- Endpoint detection identified threat
- Automatic isolation contained incident
- No production downtime occurred

**Investment**: $80K in security infrastructure saved potential $1M+ in losses

### Case Study 3: Financial Services Rapid Recovery

**Scenario**: REvil ransomware encrypted file servers during business hours.

**Recovery Timeline**:

- Hour 0: Attack detected and contained
- Hour 2: Restoration began from immutable backups
- Hour 6: Critical systems operational
- Hour 24: Full business operations resumed

**Key Success Factor**: Automated backup testing validated recovery procedures monthly
