## What You Get

An experienced platform engineer in your on-call rotation. When alerts fire, I respond with the context to triage infrastructure issues quickly—whether it's Kubernetes pod failures, database connection exhaustion, CI/CD pipeline breaks, or cloud service degradation.

This works well when:

- Your team lacks infrastructure depth for after-hours incidents
- On-call burden is burning out your developers
- You need coverage during vacations or team transitions
- Incidents require skills your current team is still building

## How It Works

**Onboarding**: We start with a paid onboarding session to review your architecture, runbooks, monitoring setup, and escalation paths. I need enough context to be effective when paged at 2 AM.

**On-Call Coverage**: I carry the pager for agreed-upon periods (nights, weekends, or specific rotation slots). Response time and escalation procedures match your existing SLAs.

**Incident Response**: When paged, I triage, mitigate, and document. Post-incident, you get a writeup of what happened and what to fix.

## Pricing

- **Onboarding**: $500 one-time setup fee
- **Retainer**: $1,500 per week for on-call availability
- **Active Response**: $150 per hour when responding to incidents (1-hour minimum per incident)
