CONTEXT: the purpose of this service is freelance on-call support, but I don't want to break it down to a specific number of hours. I'm not sure how to price this so any suggestions would make a good starting point. It should have an on-boarding fee, a fee for being on call based on the period, and then a per-hour fee ($150/hr) when actively responding to an alert. I found the following describing someone else's on-call freelance service:
