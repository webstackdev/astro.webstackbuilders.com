## What You Get

Focused engagements for infrastructure work that has a clear start and end. Unlike ongoing workstreams, these are deliverable-driven: you get a specific output (an architecture document, a migration plan, a security assessment) rather than continuous capacity.

Examples:

- Infrastructure architecture review with recommendations
- CI/CD pipeline audit and improvement roadmap
- Kubernetes migration planning and proof-of-concept
- Cloud cost analysis and optimization report
- Disaster recovery documentation and runbook creation
- Security posture assessment for infrastructure
- Technical due diligence for acquisitions

## How It Works

We scope the work together, agree on deliverables and timeline, and I execute independently. These engagements don't require daily standups or real-time collaboration—you get async updates and the finished deliverable.

Work typically happens outside business hours, which means it won't conflict with your team's regular development flow.

## Pricing

Priced per engagement based on scope. Most projects fall between $800 (half-day) and $1,600 (full-day) worth of effort, with larger assessments quoted individually. Contact me with your specific need for a fixed-price estimate.
