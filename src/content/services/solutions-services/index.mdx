CONTEXT: the intention of this service is to have a pricing structure for taking work that can be done completely outside of normal hours. It would normally be done on the weekend but I don't want to say that explicitly. It could be up to a maximum of one full day per week. I'm not sure if the best approach is to bill for a half day or full day, or have a per-hour rate. My normal rate is $100/hour.
