title: "Continuous Workstream"

CONTEXT: the purpose of this service is part-time freelancing so half-time or about twenty hours per week, but I don't want to break it down to a specific number of hours. The price is $9,500 per month. This would be out-of-normal work hours as a workflow because I don't want to get locked out of taking a full-time workstream (which is during normal business hours EST) because I have a part-time workstream going, so it's weekdays evening work.

For ongoing development and long-term partnership.

Steady progress on your roadmap without the pressure of hard deadlines.
