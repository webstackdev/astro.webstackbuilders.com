title: "Continuous Workstream"
description: "Steady platform engineering progress without full-time commitment. I work evenings EST on your infrastructure backlog—CI/CD improvements, IaC refactors, monitoring gaps, and the reliability work that keeps slipping."

## What You Get

Consistent engineering capacity at roughly half the intensity of a full workstream. Work happens weekday evenings (EST), which means your full-time team gets uninterrupted focus during business hours while infrastructure improvements still move forward.

This works well for:

- Ongoing platform maintenance and incremental improvements
- CI/CD pipeline hardening and optimization
- Infrastructure-as-code cleanup and documentation
- Monitoring and alerting gap coverage
- Technical debt reduction on infrastructure tooling
- Long-running migrations that don't need dedicated attention

## How It Works

We establish a backlog of infrastructure work and I pull from it consistently. You get predictable progress on your roadmap without hard deadlines or sprint pressure. Communication happens async with periodic syncs as needed.

This engagement complements your existing team rather than replacing capacity. It's particularly useful when you have platform work that matters but can't justify pulling developers off product features.

## Pricing

$9,500 per month. Month-to-month engagement with 30 days notice to wind down.
