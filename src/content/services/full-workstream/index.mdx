title: "Full Workstream"
description: "Dedicated platform engineering capacity for teams building or stabilizing infrastructure. I embed with your team during business hours to ship CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes deployments, observability stacks, and reliability improvements."

## What You Get

Full-time engineering capacity focused on your platform and infrastructure needs. I work EST business hours, attend standups and planning sessions, and operate as a member of your team rather than an external consultant dropping in for status meetings.

Typical engagements include:

- CI/CD pipeline design and implementation
- Kubernetes cluster setup, migration, or stabilization
- Infrastructure-as-code buildout (Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation)
- Observability and monitoring (metrics, logs, traces, alerting)
- Incident response process improvements
- Cloud architecture reviews and cost optimization
- Legacy application containerization and migration

## How It Works

We start with a kickoff to assess your current state, identify priorities, and establish communication patterns. From there, I pick up work from your backlog or drive initiatives we scope together. You get steady progress without the overhead of hiring, onboarding, and managing a full-time employee.

## Pricing

$19,500 per month. No long-term commitment required—engagements run month-to-month with 30 days notice to wind down.
