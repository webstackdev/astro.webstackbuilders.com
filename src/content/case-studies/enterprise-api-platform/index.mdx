## Challenge

TechCorp needed a unified API platform to connect disparate systems across their organization. Multiple business units were building their own integrations, leading to duplication, inconsistency, and security concerns.

## Solution

We designed and built a comprehensive enterprise API platform:

### Architecture

- RESTful API design following best practices
- OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Comprehensive API documentation

### Key Components

- **API Gateway**: Centralized entry point for all API traffic
- **Developer Portal**: Self-service documentation and API keys
- **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and alerting
- **Versioning**: Backward-compatible API evolution

## Implementation

The platform was rolled out in phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Core infrastructure and authentication
2. **Phase 2**: First set of business APIs
3. **Phase 3**: Developer portal and documentation
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features and monitoring

## Results

The API platform transformed how TechCorp's systems communicate:

- **50+ APIs** launched in the first year
- **10M+ API calls** per day
- **99.99% uptime** SLA achieved
- **30% reduction** in integration costs

## Technologies Used

- Node.js and Express for API services
- Kong for API gateway
- PostgreSQL for data persistence
- Redis for caching and rate limiting
- Kubernetes for orchestration

## Conclusion

The enterprise API platform provided TechCorp with a scalable, secure foundation for integrations, enabling faster development and better collaboration across business units.
