Platform engineering applies product thinking to infrastructure. Instead of treating internal tools as an afterthought, platform teams build self-service capabilities that reduce friction for the engineers who depend on them. The goal is not just automation, but developer experience: making the right thing easy, providing sensible defaults, and getting out of the way so product teams can ship.

This category covers the practical side of building internal platforms. A service catalog is only valuable if the metadata stays accurate and teams actually use it. Golden paths work when they are the path of least resistance, not mandates that create workarounds. Internal developer portals fail when they are link farms instead of self-service action hubs. Measuring platform success requires metrics that reflect actual developer friction, not vanity dashboards. These articles dig into the tradeoffs between standardization and autonomy, and the operational reality of treating internal developers as customers.

Whether you are designing a service catalog schema, building an internal CLI that wraps kubectl, figuring out how to deprecate internal tooling without breaking consumers, or trying to measure whether your platform is actually reducing toil, the content here reflects hands-on experience with the product management side of infrastructure.

## Cover Prompt

1. _Isometric technical illustration of an internal developer platform: a central portal node connected to self-service action buttons (deploy, provision, scaffold) with developer avatars interacting from workstations. Golden path highlighted as a glowing route through the system. Dark slate background, teal and amber accents, clean vector style. Modern, technical, product-focused aesthetic._

2. _Abstract visualization of a service catalog: interconnected service nodes with ownership badges, dependency lines, and lifecycle status indicators. Metadata panels floating beside each node showing team, SLO, and documentation links. Dark background with blue and green accents, professional technical illustration style._

3. _Split composition showing developer experience transformation: left side displays a developer navigating a maze of documentation, tickets, and manual processes; right side shows the same developer using a streamlined platform with one-click actions and clear golden paths. Before/after concept, dark theme with red (friction) to green (flow) color progression._

4. _Technical diagram of platform architecture: control plane layer at top (catalog, policies, templates) connected to data plane layer below (clusters, databases, queues) with API boundaries clearly marked. Blueprint aesthetic, dark navy background, layers rendered as translucent panels with glowing connection lines._

5. _Stylized 3D render of a developer portal dashboard with action cards (create service, request access, view logs) prominently displayed, surrounded by dimmed legacy links and documentation indexes. Contrast between actionable platform vs passive portal. Dark background, electric blue highlights on active elements, muted grey on passive elements._
