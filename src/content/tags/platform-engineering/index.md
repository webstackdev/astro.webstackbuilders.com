## GPT

__Platform Engineering (product mindset)__

- Platform products: paved roads, golden paths, opinionated defaults
- Self-service: templates, scaffolding, service catalog, runbooks as code
- Platform architecture: control plane vs data plane, tenancy, multi-team boundaries
- Adoption: measuring success without cargo-culting DORA

### GPT Article Ideas

- Golden paths without golden handcuffs
- Control plane vs data plane for internal platforms
- Service catalogs that do not rot: ownership and lifecycle enforcement
- Measuring platform success: adoption signals that beat vanity metrics

## Gemini

__Platform Engineering & IDP__

Focus on the "product" aspect of infrastructure: self-service portals, service catalogs, paving golden paths, and treating internal developers as customers.

### Gemini Article Ideas

1. __"Why Your IDP Failed: It Was Just a Link Farm"__
   - _Concept:_ Analyzing why internal portals fail when they don't offer self-service actions.
   - _Takeaway:_ Portals must reduce cognitive load, not just index it.

2. __"Designing a Service Catalog Schema That Developers Actually Use"__
   - _Concept:_ How to model ownership, lifecycle, and dependencies in Backstage or equivalent.
   - _Takeaway:_ Metadata quality determines the value of the catalog.

3. __"The 'Golden Path' Fallacy: Balancing Standardization with Autonomy"__
   - _Concept:_ When to enforce standards vs. when to allow deviation.
   - _Takeaway:_ Standardization should be the path of least resistance, not a mandate.

4. __"Building an Internal CLI: When to Wrap `kubectl` and When to Stop"__
   - _Concept:_ Pros and cons of abstraction layers over standard tools.
   - _Takeaway:_ Don't hide the underlying tool unless you add significant value.

5. __"Versioning Your Platform: Breaking Changes in Internal Tools"__
   - _Concept:_ Treating platform tools like a public API with deprecation policies.

## Opus

__Platform Engineering & Developer Experience__

The "product management" side of infrastructure: internal developer portals, service catalogs, golden paths, and treating platform as a product with internal customers.

### Article Ideas

1. __"Portal vs. Platform: Why Your IDP is Just a Dashboard"__
   - _Concept:_ The difference between a portal that links to things and a platform that does things.
   - _Takeaway:_ Self-service actions are the value; links are table stakes.

2. __"Service Catalog Schema Design: What Actually Gets Used"__
   - _Concept:_ Practical metadata modeling for Backstage or similar tools.
   - _Takeaway:_ Garbage-in, garbage-out; schema enforcement matters.

3. __"Golden Paths Without Golden Handcuffs"__
   - _Concept:_ Balancing standardization with team autonomy.
   - _Takeaway:_ Make the right thing easy, not the only option.

4. __"Internal CLIs: Abstraction Layers That Help vs. Hurt"__
   - _Concept:_ When wrapping kubectl or terraform adds value vs. complexity.
   - _Takeaway:_ If your wrapper requires reading docs to use the underlying tool, you failed.

5. __"Versioning Platform APIs: Deprecation for Internal Tools"__
   - _Concept:_ Treating internal tooling like a public API.
   - _Takeaway:_ Breaking changes need communication even internally.

6. __"Measuring Platform Team Success: Metrics That Matter"__
   - _Concept:_ Lead time, onboarding time, ticket deflection vs. vanity metrics.
   - _Takeaway:_ If you cannot measure developer friction, you cannot reduce it.
