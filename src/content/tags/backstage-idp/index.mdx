Backstage is Spotify's open-source framework for building internal developer portals, and it has become the de facto standard for platform teams that want a single pane of glass over their engineering ecosystem. Its software catalog gives every service, library, and infrastructure component a discoverable home with ownership metadata, documentation links, and dependency graphs. Software templates let platform engineers offer golden-path scaffolding so new projects start with the right CI/CD pipelines, observability, and security defaults baked in.

The plugin architecture is where Backstage earns its place in the platform engineering stack. Kubernetes dashboards, Argo CD sync status, PagerDuty on-call schedules, and cost dashboards all surface inside a single portal instead of forcing developers to context-switch between a dozen tools. The TechDocs system turns markdown in repos into browsable documentation that stays next to the services it describes.

Running Backstage in production is nontrivial. It requires a PostgreSQL backend, an authentication provider, and ongoing plugin maintenance as upstream versions evolve. The reward is a developer experience layer that turns a collection of loosely connected DevOps tools into a coherent self-service platform&mdash;exactly the abstraction that platform engineering teams exist to build.
