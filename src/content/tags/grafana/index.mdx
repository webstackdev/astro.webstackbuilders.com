Grafana has grown from a metrics dashboard into the visualization layer for the entire observability stack. Paired with Prometheus for metrics, Loki for logs, Tempo for traces, and Mimir for long-term storage, it gives platform teams a single interface to correlate signals across infrastructure and applications. The ability to jump from a spike on a dashboard panel to the exact log lines and traces that explain it is what turns monitoring from a passive display into an active debugging tool.

For platform engineering, Grafana's value is in standardization. Dashboard-as-code with Grafonnet or Terraform's Grafana provider lets teams version-control their observability views alongside the infrastructure they describe. Alerting rules defined in code, provisioned through CI, and routed through Alertmanager or Grafana's built-in contact points create a repeatable incident response foundation. SLO dashboards backed by real error budgets give service owners a shared language for reliability conversations.

The operational reality is dashboard sprawl. Without governance, every team creates bespoke dashboards that nobody else can interpret. Platform teams that invest in golden-signal dashboard templates, consistent label taxonomies, and self-service provisioning through Backstage or internal tooling get observability that scales. Those that don't end up with hundreds of dashboards and no shared understanding of system health.
