.NET and C# dominate enterprise backend development, and that makes them unavoidable in platform engineering. Many of the internal services that platform teams build on top of&mdash;identity providers, API gateways, legacy monoliths being decomposed into microservices&mdash;run on .NET. Understanding the runtime, its deployment model, and its operational characteristics is essential for building platforms that serve .NET application teams well.

From a platform engineering perspective, .NET's strengths include first-class Azure integration, mature observability through OpenTelemetry's .NET SDK, and a container story that has improved dramatically with minimal APIs and AOT compilation. Health check endpoints, structured logging with Serilog or the built-in logging abstractions, and gRPC support are all part of the standard toolkit. Platform teams can publish opinionated project templates via `dotnet new` that enforce organizational standards from the first commit.

The DevOps angle matters too. .NET builds are resource-intensive compared to Go or Python, so CI pipeline optimization&mdash;NuGet caching, incremental builds, and parallelized test execution&mdash;directly affects developer feedback loops. Understanding MSBuild, solution structure, and the NuGet dependency graph helps platform engineers design build systems that scale across hundreds of repositories without becoming a bottleneck.
