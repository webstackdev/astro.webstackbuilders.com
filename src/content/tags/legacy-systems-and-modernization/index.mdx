Strategies for inherited codebases: strangler fig migrations, test harness construction, dependency upgrades, stabilizing old .NET/Java monoliths, and moving monoliths to the cloud without full rewrites.

### Article Ideas

18. __"Strangler Fig in Practice: Extracting Auth from a Monolith"__
    - _Concept:_ Step-by-step domain extraction walkthrough, specific example of peeling off one domain at a time (e.g., Auth)
    - _Takeaway:_ Cut at the seams, not through the code.

19. __"Adding Tests to Untestable Code"__
    - _Concept:_ Techniques for legacy codebases without test coverage, getting a test harness around "untestable" code.
    - _Takeaway:_ Characterization tests first, then refactor.

20. __"Decommissioning Services: The Art of Turning Things Off"__
    - _Concept:_ Scream tests, traffic analysis, and soft shutdowns.
    - _Takeaway:_ Nobody knows what is used until you try to delete it.

21. __"Dependency Hell: Upgrading EOL Runtimes"__
    - _Concept:_ Strategies for .NET Framework, old Node, RHEL 6. Handling the pain of dependency hell when the OS is EOL.
    - _Takeaway:_ Transitive dependencies are the real enemy.

22. __"Zero-Downtime Database Migrations"__
    - _Concept:_ Expand/contract, dual-write, and schema versioning. Expand/contract strategies for schema changes.
    - _Takeaway:_ Backward compatibility is non-negotiable.

23. __"Documenting Undocumented Systems"__
    - _Concept:_ Reverse-engineering architecture from running code.
    - _Takeaway:_ Diagrams rot; tests document behavior.
