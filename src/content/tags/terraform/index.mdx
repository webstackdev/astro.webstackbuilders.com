Terraform is the most widely adopted infrastructure-as-code tool in platform engineering. Its declarative HCL syntax, plan-and-apply workflow, and provider ecosystem covering every major cloud and SaaS platform give teams a consistent way to define, version, and provision infrastructure regardless of where it runs. The state file acts as a source of truth that tracks what exists, what changed, and what needs to be created or destroyed on the next apply.

Platform teams build on Terraform by composing reusable modules that encode organizational standards. A VPC module enforces network segmentation policies, a Kubernetes cluster module wires up node pools with the right instance types and autoscaling rules, and a database module handles encryption, backup schedules, and parameter groups. Published to private registries and consumed through version-pinned module calls, these become the building blocks of self-service infrastructure that application teams request without writing HCL themselves.

The operational challenges are state management and drift. Remote state backends, state locking, and workspace isolation prevent concurrent modifications from corrupting infrastructure, but they add coordination overhead. Large monolithic state files slow plan times and increase blast radius. Teams that invest in state decomposition, automated drift detection, and policy-as-code with Sentinel or OPA build Terraform workflows that scale across hundreds of engineers and thousands of resources.
