- Build systems: caching, hermetic builds, monorepo constraints
- Deployment strategies: canary, blue/green, progressive delivery
- Release engineering: versioning, changelogs, release health, rollback semantics
- Supply chain: provenance, SBOMs, signing, trusted builders

Pipeline architecture, build optimization, deployment strategies (blue/green, canary, progressive), artifact management, release engineering, and monorepo tooling.

### Article Ideas

- Rollback semantics: why rollback often fails in practice
- Release health gates: catching real failures without blocking everything
- Build provenance and signing: a practical supply chain baseline

22. __"Optimizing CI Pipelines: Caching Strategies That Work"__
    - _Concept:_ Docker layer caching, dependency caching, and when to clean the cache / invalidation.
    - _Takeaway:_ Cache keys are harder than they look.

24. __"GitOps Failure Modes: When ArgoCD Sync Breaks"__
    - _Concept:_ Troubleshooting sync waves, hooks, and deadlocks. Troubleshooting common GitOps deadlocks and sync waves.
    - _Takeaway:_ Declarative does not mean debuggable.

26. __"Blue/Green vs. Canary: Choosing Deployment Strategies"__
    - _Concept:_ Tradeoffs for stateless vs. stateful workloads. Complexity vs. safety tradeoffs for different application types. Canary without a service mesh
    - _Takeaway:_ Database state complicates everything.

27. __"Database Migrations in CD Pipelines"__
    - _Concept:_ Automating schema changes without downtime. Automating schema migrations within a GitOps pipeline safely.
    - _Takeaway:_ Never mix schema and code deploys.

28. __"Release Engineering for Monorepos: Tooling and Tactics"__
    - _Concept:_ Affected-based builds and remote caching.
    - _Takeaway:_ Build what changed, cache what did not.
