Cloud infrastructure is where abstractions meet reality. Kubernetes promises declarative workload management, but delivering on that promise requires understanding scheduling semantics, networking quirks, and the failure modes that emerge when you actually run production traffic. This category covers the operational side of cloud-native infrastructure: container orchestration, multi-cluster patterns, infrastructure-as-code tooling, and the cloud provider specifics that documentation glosses over.

The focus is practical. Requests and limits sound straightforward until a misconfigured QoS class causes cascading evictions during a traffic spike. Terraform state management is simple until your team discovers locking race conditions during a rollback. Helm releases work fine until drift accumulates across dozens of services and nobody knows what is actually deployed. These articles address the gaps between documentation and production.

Whether you are sizing pods with incomplete metrics, debugging DNS latency in a cluster, planning a Kubernetes upgrade that will not wake anyone up, or trying to understand why your cloud bill keeps climbing, the content here draws from hands-on experience with the unglamorous work of keeping infrastructure reliable.

## Cover Prompt

1. _Isometric technical illustration of a Kubernetes cluster: control plane nodes connected to worker nodes via glowing network lines, with pod icons distributed across nodes showing resource utilization gauges. Clean vector style, dark slate background with blue and teal accents, subtle hexagonal grid pattern. Modern, technical, enterprise-grade aesthetic, no text._

2. _Abstract visualization of cloud infrastructure layers: stylized cloud shapes at the top flowing down through container symbols, orchestration nodes, and physical server racks at the bottom. Layered depth effect with translucent panels, dark background with gradient from deep purple (cloud) to electric blue (metal). Professional technical illustration style._

3. _Technical diagram showing Terraform state flow: code files transforming through plan/apply stages into deployed infrastructure icons (VPCs, clusters, databases). Rendered as a glowing flowchart on dark background, with green (success) and amber (drift) status indicators. Blueprint aesthetic with clean sans-serif labels, suitable for infrastructure documentation._

4. _Stylized 3D render of interconnected Kubernetes pods represented as glowing cubes within a cluster mesh, with service mesh connections shown as neon threads. Namespace boundaries visible as translucent walls. Cyberpunk-influenced palette (deep blue, cyan, magenta accents) on matte black. High detail, technical but visually striking._

5. _Split composition: left side shows a tangled mess of manually provisioned servers with inconsistent configurations; right side shows clean infrastructure-as-code with version-controlled, repeatable deployments. Before/after transformation concept. Technical illustration style, warm orange (chaos) vs cool blue (order), dark background with subtle grid._
