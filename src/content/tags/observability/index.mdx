## GPT

__Observability and Telemetry__

- Logging: structured logs, sampling, correlation, redaction
- Metrics: cardinality, exemplars, aggregation choices
- Tracing: propagation, span design, tail-based sampling
- Alerting: signal design, paging policies, noise reduction

### GPT Article Ideas

- Structured logging: field naming, correlation IDs, and redaction
- Metrics cardinality: what breaks first and how to design around it
- Tracing span design: how many spans is too many
- Tail-based sampling: when it is worth the complexity
- Alerting on symptoms vs causes: a signal design framework

    - _Concept:_ Log schemas, correlation IDs, and dropping noise.
    - _Takeaway:_ Consistency beats flexibility.

32. __"Dashboard Hygiene: Pruning Grafana"__
    - _Concept:_ Auditing unused dashboards and panels.
    - _Takeaway:_ If nobody looks at it, delete it.

33. __"Alert Fatigue: From Causes to Symptoms"__
    - _Concept:_ Symptom-based alerting and runbook-driven alerts.
    - _Takeaway:_ Alert on what matters, not what is easy to measure.
