- Workload models: deployments vs stateful sets, jobs, cronjobs
- Networking: ingress, gateways, service mesh tradeoffs
- Scheduling: requests/limits, QoS classes, disruption budgets
- Operations: upgrades, node lifecycle, autoscaling behavior

- AWS / Azure / GCP: comparative architecture notes, migration stories
- Identity and auth: IAM design, workload identity, federation
- Networking: DNS, TLS, private connectivity, routing failure modes
- Cost and performance: cost drivers, right-sizing, scaling behavior
Hard technical guides on container orchestration, cloud-native patterns, infrastructure-as-code (Terraform/OpenTofu), and networking.

Container orchestration, multi-cluster patterns, networking deep dives, infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, OpenTofu, Pulumi), and cloud provider specifics.

__Infrastructure as Code and Environments__

- Terraform: module design, versioning, provider constraints, state
- Helm/Kustomize: render pipelines, drift, release management
- Environments: ephemeral preview envs, config layering, secrets
- Policy and guardrails: OPA/Conftest patterns, IaC security scanning

## GPT Article Ideas

### GPT Article Ideas

- Terraform module interfaces: defaults, extensibility, and versioning
- Terraform state: failure modes, locking, and recovery strategies
- Helm releases at scale: drift, debugging, and repeatability
- Ephemeral environments: preview deploys without runaway cost
- Policy as code: guardrails with fast feedback loops

- Requests and limits deep dive: QoS classes and outage behavior
- Disruption budgets: surviving node rotations and autoscaler churn
- Autoscaling reality check: HPA signals, delays, and common traps
- Ingress vs Gateway API: choosing pragmatically
- Kubernetes upgrade playbook: making cluster upgrades boring

__Cloud Platforms__

- Workload identity: eliminating long-lived cloud keys
- Private networking basics: DNS, routing, and TLS failure modes
- Cost drivers in Kubernetes: the boring stuff that moves the bill
- Migration pattern: strangler fig with observability-first sequencing
