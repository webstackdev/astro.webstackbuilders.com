Platform engineering sits at the intersection of software development and systems administration. This category covers the foundational technologies that do not fit neatly into infrastructure-as-code or observability buckets but are essential to the work: TypeScript for tooling and automation, Linux for everything that runs on servers, messaging systems like RabbitMQ and Kafka for async communication, and databases like PostgreSQL for persistent state.

The focus here is practical depth. TypeScript articles address the type system patterns that make platform tooling maintainable. Linux content covers the administration fundamentals that come up when debugging containers or configuring hosts. Messaging system articles dig into the operational reality of queues, consumers, and failure modes. Database content addresses the schema design, query optimization, and operational concerns that platform engineers encounter when supporting application teams.

Whether you are writing a CLI tool in TypeScript, troubleshooting a Linux networking issue, designing a message queue topology, or optimizing PostgreSQL queries, the content here reflects hands-on experience with the technologies that underpin everything else.

## Cover Prompt

1. _Isometric technical illustration of a developer workstation: code editor showing TypeScript, terminal with Linux commands, and service icons (database, message queue, container) connected via data flow lines. Dark slate background, blue and teal accents, clean vector style. Modern, technical, full-stack aesthetic._

2. _Abstract visualization of system components: a central application node connected to PostgreSQL (elephant icon), RabbitMQ (rabbit), Kafka (streaming arrows), and Linux servers (penguin). Data flowing between components as glowing streams. Dark background with colorful service-specific accents, professional technical illustration style._

3. _Split composition showing development workflow: left side displays raw code and system logs; right side shows typed interfaces, structured queries, and organized message flows. Code-to-production concept, dark theme with syntax highlighting colors (TypeScript blue, terminal green, error red)._

4. _Technical diagram of a typical platform stack: TypeScript tooling layer at top, application services in middle, backing services (databases, queues, caches) at bottom, all running on Linux hosts. Blueprint aesthetic, dark navy background, layers rendered as translucent panels with glowing connection lines._

5. _Stylized 3D render of interconnected technology logos arranged as nodes in a network: TypeScript, Linux (Tux), PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Kafka. Each node glowing with its brand color, connected by data flow ribbons. Dark background, vibrant but professional color palette, foundational technology aesthetic._
