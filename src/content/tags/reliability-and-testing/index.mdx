Reliability engineering is the practice of keeping systems running when everything conspires to make them fail. It spans the technical (circuit breakers, backpressure, retry budgets) and the organizational (incident response, blameless postmortems, on-call rotations that do not burn people out). The goal is not perfection but predictability: understanding how systems fail, measuring what matters, and making informed tradeoffs between availability and velocity.

This category covers both the SRE fundamentals and the testing practices that support them. SLOs sound simple until you try to pick indicators that actually reflect user experience. Error budgets are powerful negotiation tools until leadership treats them as targets instead of tradeoffs. On-call rotations work until you have three people and 200 alerts. E2E tests provide confidence until flakiness erodes trust. These articles dig into the operational reality of reliability work, where the hard part is rarely the technology.

Whether you are introducing SLOs to a team that has never measured availability, trying to reduce alert fatigue without missing real incidents, debugging flaky tests that only fail in CI, or running chaos experiments without an expensive platform, the content here reflects hands-on experience with the unglamorous work of keeping production healthy.
