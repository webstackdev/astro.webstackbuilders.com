Reliability engineering is the practice of keeping systems running when everything conspires to make them fail. It spans the technical (circuit breakers, backpressure, retry budgets) and the organizational (incident response, blameless postmortems, on-call rotations that do not burn people out). The goal is not perfection but predictability: understanding how systems fail, measuring what matters, and making informed tradeoffs between availability and velocity.

This category covers both the SRE fundamentals and the testing practices that support them. SLOs sound simple until you try to pick indicators that actually reflect user experience. Error budgets are powerful negotiation tools until leadership treats them as targets instead of tradeoffs. On-call rotations work until you have three people and 200 alerts. E2E tests provide confidence until flakiness erodes trust. These articles dig into the operational reality of reliability work, where the hard part is rarely the technology.

Whether you are introducing SLOs to a team that has never measured availability, trying to reduce alert fatigue without missing real incidents, debugging flaky tests that only fail in CI, or running chaos experiments without an expensive platform, the content here reflects hands-on experience with the unglamorous work of keeping production healthy.

## Cover Prompt

1. _Isometric technical illustration of an incident response war room: monitoring dashboards showing error spikes, team members coordinating via chat, runbooks and escalation paths visualized as connected nodes. SLO budget gauges prominent. Dark slate background, red and green status accents, clean vector style. Modern, technical, high-stakes aesthetic._

2. _Abstract visualization of system resilience: a service mesh with circuit breakers, retry logic, and backpressure valves rendered as mechanical components. Traffic flow shown as streams that get throttled, rerouted, or shed under load. Dark background with teal and amber highlights, professional technical illustration style._

3. _Split composition showing on-call transformation: left side displays an engineer drowning in alert noise with pager fatigue indicators; right side shows curated alerts, clear runbooks, and healthy error budget. Before/after concept, dark theme with red (burnout) to green (sustainable) color progression._

4. _Technical diagram of SLO architecture: user journey at top flowing through SLIs (latency, error rate, throughput) into error budget calculations and alerting thresholds. Budget burn rate visualized as a gauge with policy triggers. Blueprint aesthetic, dark navy background, metrics rendered as glowing data streams._

5. _Stylized 3D render of a testing pyramid with E2E tests at the apex showing flaky test indicators, contract tests in the middle with schema compatibility checks, and unit tests at the base. Some tests glowing green (stable), others amber (flaky). Dark background, electric blue and warning orange accents, quality-focused aesthetic._
