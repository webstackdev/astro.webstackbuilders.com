Azure occupies a unique position in enterprise platform engineering because of its deep integration with Microsoft's identity and productivity stack. Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) gives platform teams federated identity, conditional access, and workload identity federation out of the box&mdash;capabilities that take significant effort to replicate on other clouds. AKS provides managed Kubernetes with tight Azure networking integration, and Azure DevOps offers a mature CI/CD pipeline system that many enterprises already have in place.

For platform engineers, Azure's strength is its enterprise governance tooling. Management Groups, Azure Policy, and Blueprints let you enforce guardrails across hundreds of subscriptions. Landing Zones provide prescriptive architecture for multi-team environments, and Bicep offers a cleaner infrastructure-as-code experience than ARM templates while remaining a first-party citizen. Combined with Terraform's AzureRM provider, teams have real flexibility in how they define and provision infrastructure.

The challenge is navigating Azure's layered service model and frequent rebranding. Services shift names, preview features graduate unpredictably, and the relationship between Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions continues to evolve. Successful Azure platform teams build abstraction layers that shield application developers from these shifts while still leveraging the platform's enterprise integration advantages.
