APIs are the connective tissue of distributed systems, and the infrastructure surrounding them determines whether those systems scale gracefully or collapse under load. This category covers the full spectrum of API platform engineering: from gateway configuration and rate limiting to versioning strategies that do not strand consumers, and from edge computing patterns to the reverse proxies and CDNs that sit between your services and the outside world.

The focus here is operational reality. Rate limiting sounds simple until you accidentally DoS your own users during a traffic spike. API versioning is straightforward until you need to deprecate an endpoint with 200 active consumers and no migration path. Edge caching improves latency until a misconfigured Vary header serves stale data to the wrong users. These articles dig into the tradeoffs, failure modes, and production lessons that documentation rarely covers.

Whether you are building an internal API platform for engineering teams, hardening a public API against abuse, or trying to understand why your reverse proxy keeps timing out under load, the content here reflects hands-on experience with the messy intersection of performance, correctness, and cost.
