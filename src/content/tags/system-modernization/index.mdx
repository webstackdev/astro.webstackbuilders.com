Every organization has systems that predate the current team. These inherited codebases come with sparse documentation, outdated dependencies, implicit knowledge locked in the heads of engineers who left years ago, and a velocity tax that compounds over time. This category covers the practical work of modernizing legacy systems without the luxury of a ground-up rewrite.

The approach here is incremental and risk-aware. Strangler fig migrations let you extract functionality piece by piece while keeping production running. Test harness construction gives you a safety net before refactoring code you do not fully understand. Dependency upgrades on EOL runtimes require careful sequencing to avoid breaking transitive dependencies. Database schema changes demand backward-compatible migration patterns. None of this is glamorous, but it is the work that actually moves old systems forward.

Whether you are trying to add tests to code that was never designed for testability, planning a cloud migration for a .NET Framework monolith, or figuring out how to decommission a service that nobody remembers but everyone depends on, these articles draw from hands-on experience with the slow, methodical work of making legacy systems manageable.

## Cover Prompt

1. _Isometric technical illustration of a legacy monolith being incrementally wrapped by modern microservices: a large grey server block at center with vines (strangler fig metaphor) of glowing blue service nodes growing around it. Dark background, teal and amber accents, clean vector style. Modern, technical, transformation narrative._

2. _Split composition showing code archaeology: left side displays tangled spaghetti code with question marks and missing documentation icons; right side shows the same system with test coverage indicators, dependency graphs, and documentation layers added. Before/after concept, dark theme with red (legacy) to green (stabilized) gradient._

3. _Abstract visualization of a migration timeline: old infrastructure icons (on-prem servers, outdated frameworks) on the left transforming through intermediate stages into cloud-native architecture on the right. Rendered as a flowing ribbon with milestone markers, dark background with orange-to-blue color progression. Professional technical illustration._

4. _Technical diagram showing expand/contract database migration pattern: two database schemas side by side with dual-write arrows, version indicators, and rollback paths highlighted. Blueprint aesthetic with dark navy background, schema tables rendered as glowing panels, green (new) and amber (old) color coding._

5. _Stylized 3D render of a test harness being constructed around legacy code: scaffolding and safety nets wrapping an older monolithic structure, with test coverage percentage indicators glowing on each section. Construction site metaphor meets software engineering. Dark background, safety orange and electric blue accents._
