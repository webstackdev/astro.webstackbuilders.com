Teams enable container scanning and immediately face 47 critical vulnerabilities. Half are in base image packages the application never uses. A quarter have no available fix. The rest require major version bumps taking weeks to test. The team disables scanning "temporarily" and never re-enables it. The scanner meant to improve security has created learned helplessness instead. The fix isn't better scanners—it's policies that lead to actionable findings.

This complete guide teaches you how to implement container scanning that developers will actually use.
