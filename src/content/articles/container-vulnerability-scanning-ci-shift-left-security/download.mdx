Teams enable container scanning and immediately face 47 critical vulnerabilities. Half are in base image packages the application never uses. A quarter have no available fix. The rest require major version bumps taking weeks to test. The team disables scanning "temporarily" and never re-enables it. The scanner meant to improve security has created learned helplessness instead. The fix isn't better scanners—it's policies that lead to actionable findings.

This complete guide teaches you how to implement container scanning that developers will actually use.

Read this e-book to understand:

- Where vulnerabilities hide in container layers and why 60% exist outside application code
- CVSS scores vs. contextual priority: why a critical vulnerability might not matter for your use case
- Types of findings: OS packages, dependencies, configurations, secrets, malware, and remediation strategies
- Scanner selection, integration, and policy configuration that balances security with development velocity
- Exception workflows for unfixable CVEs and base image upgrade strategies
- Measuring security posture: metrics that tell you if you're actually improving
- Supply chain attacks and detecting malicious packages in dependencies

Download Your Container Security & Shift-Left Scanning Guide now to implement scanning that reduces risk without creating developer friction.
