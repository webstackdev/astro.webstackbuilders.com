Enabling mutual TLS between services is a single configuration flag in most service meshes. Operating it reliably is where teams struggle. A team enabled Istio mTLS across 50 services, but the intermediate CA certificate—with a forgotten 90-day default TTL—expired at 2:47 AM, killing all inter-service communication simultaneously. Recovery took four hours because the runbook didn't exist. The lesson: mTLS without lifecycle automation is a time bomb.

The mTLS system has multiple certificate layers (workload, issuing CA, intermediate CA, root CA), each with different TTLs. An outage can originate at any layer, but most teams monitor only workload certificates.
