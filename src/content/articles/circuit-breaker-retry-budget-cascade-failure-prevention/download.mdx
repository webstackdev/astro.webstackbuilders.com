A payment service starts responding slowly due to database connection pool exhaustion. Response times climb from 50ms to 2 seconds. Every upstream service has a 1-second timeout configured, so requests start timing out. Each caller retries 3 times. The payment service, already struggling with connection issues, now receives 4x the normal traffic. Its request queue grows to thousands. What started as a 30-second database blip becomes a 2-hour cascading outage across your entire platform.

The root cause wasn't the database. It was the retry behavior. Retries without limits are a distributed denial-of-service attack against your own infrastructure. When a downstream service fails, uncoordinated retries exponentially amplify the load, turning minor issues into catastrophic outages. With 3 services in a chain, each retrying 3 times, you get 64x load amplification. With 4 services and 5 retries? 1,296x amplification.

This complete guide teaches you how to implement circuit breakers and retry budgets to break the cascade failure cycle.
