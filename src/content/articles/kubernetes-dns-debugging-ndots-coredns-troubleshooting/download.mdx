An application works perfectly in development. In Kubernetes, external API calls take 5+ seconds while the API responds in 100ms. After hours debugging network policies and service meshes, the culprit is revealed: `ndots:5` on a default `resolv.conf`. Every lookup like `api.stripe.com` tries the search domain first: `api.stripe.com.default.svc.cluster.local`, `api.stripe.com.svc.cluster.local`, `api.stripe.com.cluster.local`. Three failed lookups at one second each equals the mysterious latency. The fix: add a trailing dot. DNS is often the problem. Rule it out early to avoid hours of debugging in the wrong direction.

This complete guide teaches you how to debug Kubernetes DNS systematically.
