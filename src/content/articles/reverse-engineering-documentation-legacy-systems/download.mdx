You've inherited a system with a README last updated three years ago, architecture diagrams referencing deleted services, and an API spec describing 60% of actual endpoints. Every long-lived system follows the same trajectory: accurate documentation at launch, gradual drift as changes accumulate, and eventually a state where documentation is worse than useless. By year three, architecture has drifted so far that diagrams show services that were deprecated 18 months ago. By year five, documentation becomes actively misleading, causing new team members to form incorrect mental models that take months to unlearn.

The approach isn't documenting everything from scratch—it's systematically extracting knowledge from the running system and codebase.

This complete guide teaches you:
