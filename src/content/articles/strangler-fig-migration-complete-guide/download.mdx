The strangler fig pattern trades big-bang risk for incremental progress by building the new system around the old one, shifting traffic slowly, and only decommissioning legacy when proven. The core insight: you can't migrate what you can't observe. Before touching any traffic, establish baselines for normal operation—metrics, response patterns, error rates. With strangler fig, each increment is a small bet. A failure at 5% traffic is containable; at 100% it becomes an outage. Big-bang migrations have single points of failure; strangler fig delivers value incrementally while you learn.

Auth extraction is the hardest extraction—if you can migrate auth, you can migrate anything.
