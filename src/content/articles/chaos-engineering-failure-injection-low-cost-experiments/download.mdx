A team spent four months evaluating enterprise chaos platforms before running their first experiment. Two weeks before they could start, a routine data center power test knocked out a PDU—exposing critical bugs that a fifteen-minute pod-kill experiment would have found. The expensive platform was never needed.

Chaos engineering doesn't require enterprise tools or dedicated teams. You can start today with `kubectl delete pod` and a hypothesis. This complete guide teaches you how to build a chaos engineering practice from your first experiment through sustainable, automated resilience testing—using only free tools.
