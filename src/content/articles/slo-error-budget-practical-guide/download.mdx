Engineering teams want to ship faster. Operations teams want stability. Without a shared framework, every deployment becomes a political negotiation. SLOs transform that into math: instead of "is this change safe enough?" the question becomes "do we have budget to spend on this risk?" The answer is a number, not an opinion. SLIs measure what matters to users, SLOs set targets for those measurements, and error budgets convert the gap between 100% and your target into a spendable resource. When you have budget, spend it on velocity. When depleted, invest in reliability. This framework replaces opinions with data.

100% reliability is neither achievable nor desirable—every additional nine costs exponentially more while providing diminishing returns.
