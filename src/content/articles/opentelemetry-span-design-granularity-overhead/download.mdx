More spans provide more visibility—that's the intuition. But each span has costs: CPU overhead for creation, memory for attributes, network bandwidth for export, storage in your backend, and cognitive load reading traces. A team instrumented every function call, database query, cache lookup, and external request, generating 200+ spans per request. The trace waterfall became solid color with no visible hierarchy. Debugging meant scrolling through hundreds of spans. Storage costs tripled in a month. They refactored to 15-20 spans per request, traces became readable, critical paths were obvious, and storage costs dropped 90%.

Granularity without readability is noise, not observability.
