More spans provide more visibility—that's the intuition. But each span has costs: CPU overhead for creation, memory for attributes, network bandwidth for export, storage in your backend, and cognitive load reading traces. A team instrumented every function call, database query, cache lookup, and external request, generating 200+ spans per request. The trace waterfall became solid color with no visible hierarchy. Debugging meant scrolling through hundreds of spans. Storage costs tripled in a month. They refactored to 15-20 spans per request, traces became readable, critical paths were obvious, and storage costs dropped 90%.

Granularity without readability is noise, not observability.

This complete guide teaches you:

- Span fundamentals: identity, naming, timing, status, attributes, and events
- Context propagation: automatic parent-child relationships and trace continuity
- Span hierarchy: designing readable waterfalls with meaningful nesting
- Overhead analysis: CPU, memory, network, and storage costs by span count
- Sampling strategies: probabilistic and dynamic sampling to control costs
- Semantic conventions: following OpenTelemetry standards for consistency
- Common instrumentation patterns: HTTP, database, cache, and messaging
- Debugging traces: finding slow operations in readable waterfalls
- Tail-based sampling: collecting traces based on error or duration
