Moving workloads to private networks makes sense for security—no public IPs, traffic stays within cloud boundaries. But private networking introduces failure modes that don't exist with public connectivity. DNS resolution fails with private endpoints. Routing requires explicit configuration. TLS certificates get rejected privately. A database migration to a private endpoint led to a 3-day debugging marathon: DNS resolved to the wrong IP, routes were missing, NAT masked the real connection origin, and certificates lacked the private DNS name. Each layer had its own failure masked by generic error messages. After that, every subsequent migration followed a debugging checklist: DNS → routing → connectivity → TLS → application.

Private networking is a fundamentally different debugging domain where familiar tools give unfamiliar results.
