A payment processing queue accumulates 50,000 messages in its DLQ over three months. Nobody knows why they failed—original errors weren't captured. Nobody knows if they're safe to replay. Some might cause duplicate charges; others reference non-existent customers. The team debates, then deletes them and hopes no one notices. That's data loss with extra steps. A well-designed DLQ captures context for debugging, classifies failures, and enables safe replay. Design for drain, not for dump.

This complete guide teaches you how to build DLQs that are actually useful.
