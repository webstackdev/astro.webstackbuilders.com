OpenAPI promises a single specification file generating accurate documentation, type-safe SDKs, and request validation. Write once, generate everywhere. The reality depends on one question: is the spec the source of truth, or is it describing code that exists? Teams with hand-written documentation in Confluence, manually-coded SDKs in three languages, and duplicated validation logic see docs perpetually out of date and SDK bugs on API changes. When teams adopt spec-first OpenAPI—where the spec drives implementation—documentation generates automatically, SDKs regenerate on change, and validation uses the same spec the docs reference.

Time spent on API maintenance drops significantly when all three artifacts come from the same source.
