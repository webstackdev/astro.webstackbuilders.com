Every software supply chain has weak points. SolarWinds attackers inserted malicious code into legitimate builds affecting 18,000 customers. Codecov's bash uploader was compromised, exfiltrating credentials from thousands of organizations. Dependency confusion attacks exploited package manager ordering to inject malicious code. Perfect supply chain security is impossible, but a practical baseline using provenance and signing is achievable with free, open-source tools. SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) provides a framework for proving artifacts came from specific sources through verified build processes.

Build provenance proves that an artifact matches the code and build process you reviewed—it doesn't guarantee the code is free of vulnerabilities.

This complete guide teaches you:

- Supply chain attack vectors: source compromise, build tampering, and artifact substitution
- SLSA levels: what each level requires and when to target which level
- Build provenance: generating and verifying attestations about artifact origin
- Artifact signing: cryptographic verification with Cosign and keyless signing
- Deployment verification: enforcing signed artifacts in production
- Practical implementation: free tools and integration with CI/CD platforms
