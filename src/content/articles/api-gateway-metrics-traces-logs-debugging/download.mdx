Four hours debugging a latency spike revealed the problem: the gateway metrics measured the wrong thing. Users saw 5-second delays, the gateway dashboard showed 200ms P99 latency, and every backend claimed sub-100ms response times. The real issue—4 seconds spent waiting for slow consumers to upload request bodies—never appeared in any metric. Gateway observability that does not connect to upstream and downstream services is useless.

This complete guide shows you how to instrument API gateways so the data actually helps during incidents instead of obscuring what is really happening.
