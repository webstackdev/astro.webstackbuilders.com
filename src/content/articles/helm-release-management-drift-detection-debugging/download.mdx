An engineer runs `kubectl edit` during an incident to bump memory limits. A failed upgrade leaves resources in a partially-updated state. Three weeks later, someone tries to rollback a Helm release. The rollback fails because Helm's stored manifest doesn't match what's in the cluster. Helm's three-way merge produces unexpected results. The team spends 45 minutes reconciling state. Helm tracks its declared state in Secrets, but the cluster is the source of truth. When these diverge—through manual edits, partial upgrades, or failed releases—Helm's model breaks. At scale, drift isn't if, it's when.

This complete guide teaches you how to detect and prevent drift in Helm deployments.
