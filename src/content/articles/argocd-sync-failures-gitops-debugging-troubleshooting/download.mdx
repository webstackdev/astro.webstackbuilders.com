GitOps sells you on declarative simplicity: define your desired state in Git, and ArgoCD makes it so. The pitch works beautifully in demos. In production, you'll eventually stare at a sync that's been "Progressing" for 20 minutes, wondering what's happening inside the black box. A production deployment hung during sync with no error, no timeout, no logs—just a spinner. The root cause: a sync wave ordering issue where a PreSync hook was waiting for a service that wouldn't exist until a later wave.

This is the gap between GitOps theory and operational reality. The declarative model abstracts away the _how_ until something goes wrong. Then you need to understand exactly what ArgoCD is doing.

This complete guide breaks down the sync process and catalogs the failure modes to help you debug when ArgoCD gets stuck.

Read this e-book to understand:

- The ArgoCD sync process phase by phase: detection, manifest generation, diff calculation, resource ordering, health checks
- Sync waves and resource ordering—explicit control over which resources deploy first
- Hook execution (PreSync, Sync, PostSync) and common deadlock scenarios
- Health assessment and why your perfectly valid manifests might not become healthy
- Progressive sync strategies to reduce blast radius and enable rollback
- Debugging techniques: reading sync logs, understanding resource status, tracing hook execution
- Common failure modes and their recognition patterns
- The mental model behind ArgoCD's behavior to reason about failures
- Real examples of production sync failures and how they were resolved

Download Your GitOps Debugging Guide now to move beyond the declarative abstraction and understand what ArgoCD is actually doing.
