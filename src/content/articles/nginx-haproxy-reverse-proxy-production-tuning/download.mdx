Nginx and HAProxy ship with defaults optimized for getting started, not handling production traffic. A team's API behind Nginx with default configuration saw intermittent 502 errors at 5,000 RPS. The backend looked healthy, but `proxy_read_timeout` defaulted to 60 seconds—slow endpoints taking 65 seconds exceeded it. Meanwhile, `worker_connections` was 1024, and keep-alives holding connections open caused connection starvation during traffic spikes. After tuning timeouts and increasing worker connections, the 502s disappeared. Proxy configuration is where traffic patterns meet system limits.

Production tuning isn't optional optimization—it's the difference between graceful handling and dropped connections under load.
