Running multiple Kubernetes clusters is easy—keeping them consistent is hard. A platform team managing 15 clusters across dev, staging, and production regions faced the same problem: clusters started identical but hotfixes applied to some, manual changes became permanent, and nobody knew what was intentionally different versus accidentally drifted.

The multi-cluster challenge isn't really about tools. It's about operating models—balancing consistency with environment flexibility, detecting drift, and maintaining clarity about what should be identical versus what should vary.

Kubernetes Federation promised unified multi-cluster management but failed because it tried to abstract cluster differences—real deployments need those differences. GitOps-based fleet management using ArgoCD, Flux, and similar tools solves this by letting each cluster pull its own configuration from Git, with templating handling variations.
