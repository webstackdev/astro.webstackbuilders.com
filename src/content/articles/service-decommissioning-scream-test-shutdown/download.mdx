Spinning up a new service requires effort. Turning off an old one is harder because deletion has unbounded risk—you won't know what breaks until it breaks. So services accumulate, burning money and expanding attack surface. Zombie services receive occasional traffic that could be health checks or production workloads. They haven't been deployed in months but might be "stable." Their owning teams dissolved in reorgs. The uncertainty keeps them running. Meanwhile, direct costs pile up—compute, storage, licenses, security patches—and indirect costs grow—every zombie confuses new engineers about what's production-critical.

Understanding usage patterns and implementing controlled shutdown prevents phantom dependencies from blocking decommissioning.

This complete guide teaches you:

- Signs of decommissioning candidates: zero traffic, no deployments, deprecated dependencies
- The scream test: progressive degradation to surface dependencies safely
- Traffic analysis: identifying actual consumers versus monitoring noise
- Soft shutdown patterns: graceful degradation and Retry-After headers
- Data migration: archiving before complete deletion
- Communication strategies: deprecation notices across channels
- Rollback triggers: automatic recovery when unexpected dependencies surface
