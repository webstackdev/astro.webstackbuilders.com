A developer spent three days getting a PostgreSQL database. The company had a beautiful internal developer portal with service catalog and scorecards. He found the database docs in 30 seconds. Then the instructions: file a Jira ticket, wait for triage, attend a review meeting to justify the request, receive credentials via another ticket. Three to five business days. The portal worked perfectly. The developer still waited the same time. A portal indexes things: links, documentation, ownership. A platform does things: provisions infrastructure, creates repositories, grants access. Most organizations plateau at building a directory instead of a platform. Without self-service actions, you've built a prettier wiki.

This complete guide teaches you how to transform your portal into an actual platform.

Read this e-book to understand:

- Portal maturity model: directory, search, insights, and platform—where most organizations get stuck
- Self-service actions that developers actually use: clear inputs, fast feedback, transparent workflows
- Workflow automation: connecting forms to backend systems without complex integrations
- Feedback and visibility: showing progress, outcomes, and next steps clearly
- Governance and safety: self-service without chaos, guardrails that don't create friction
- Scaling actions: handling multiple services, teams, and environments consistently
- Measuring platform adoption: tracking which actions developers use and iterating based on usage
