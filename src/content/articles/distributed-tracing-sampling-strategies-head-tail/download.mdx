A system handling 10,000 RPS with 20 spans per trace and 1KB per span generates 200MB per second—17TB daily. At typical vendor pricing, that's $155,000 monthly just for storage. Random sampling at 1% reduces costs but loses value: errors are rare, so you'll miss them. Slow requests disappear. Finding specific traces becomes impossible. The goal isn't cost reduction—it's signal improvement. Keep traces that teach you something (errors, latency outliers), discard millions of identical successful requests.

This complete guide teaches you how to sample traces intelligently.
