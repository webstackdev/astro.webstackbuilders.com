Quality gates exist to catch bad deployments, but gates too strict become the biggest obstacle to velocity. A team implemented full-stack gates: tests, coverage, security, performance. After a month, exceptions accumulated—a scanner vulnerability flagged from 2019, coverage dropped 0.1%, cold-start performance triggered. The gate configuration had so many exceptions it caught nothing. They rebuilt with required gates (critical tests, CVE 9+) and advisory gates (coverage trends, performance baselines). False positives dropped 90%, and when required gates fired, people investigated because they trusted the signals.

The measure of a good gate isn't deployments blocked—it's real incidents prevented relative to good deployments delayed.
