An engineer fat-fingers a production config change. The payment service goes down for two hours. The instinctive investigation finds the engineer and assigns blame. But three months later, a different engineer makes a different config mistake, and the system fails the same way. The "solution" didn't prevent anything—it just rotated blame to someone new.

The blameless investigation asks different questions: Why could a single engineer make that change without review? Why was there no canary deployment? Why didn't monitoring catch the error rate spike before customers did? That investigation finds five systemic improvements instead of one scapegoat.

This isn't about being soft on mistakes. It's about being rigorous enough to find causes that actually prevent recurrence.

This complete guide helps you build postmortem practices that actually improve your systems.
