Service catalogs follow a predictable arc: leadership launches initiative, teams enter services, six months later nobody trusts the data. The catalog becomes that thing you're supposed to update but don't. The failure isn't discipline—it's schema design. A catalog relying on humans remembering to update it will decay. One validating data at deploy time, discovering dependencies from traffic, and alerting on drift has a chance. By year one, ownership is stale, by year two, the catalog becomes a liability. Coverage drops from 90% at launch to 45% by year two. Trust plummets from 85% to 10%.

A catalog with 80% accurate data is more dangerous than no catalog—it creates false confidence.
