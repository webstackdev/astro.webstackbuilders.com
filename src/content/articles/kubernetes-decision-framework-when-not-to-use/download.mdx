A five-person startup runs a monolithic application on three VMs. Everything works. Deployments are simple. Then someone decides they need Kubernetes because "it's industry standard." Six months later, they run the same application on Kubernetes, but now 40% of engineering time goes to infrastructure instead of product. Kubernetes solves specific problems: multi-service orchestration, complex networking, multi-team isolation, sophisticated scaling. If you don't have those problems, you're paying the Kubernetes tax without benefits. The goal is running workloads reliably, not using any particular technology.

This complete guide teaches you when to use Kubernetes and when simpler alternatives win.
