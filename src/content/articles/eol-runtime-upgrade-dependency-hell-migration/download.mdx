Your runtime hits EOL. You need to upgrade. Your code is compatible, direct dependencies support the new version, but a transitive dependency three levels deep pins an incompatible package. You're blocked by code you don't own and never reviewed. The blocker isn't your code—it's packages you don't directly call, native modules in transitive dependencies, and build tooling expecting older ABIs. Longer gaps between versions compound breakage: abandoned libraries, renamed packages, removed APIs, incompatible binaries.

This complete guide teaches you how to escape dependency hell.

Read this e-book to understand:

- The hidden transitive dependency graph: why one incompatible package four levels deep blocks your upgrade
- Direct vs. transitive dependencies: tools to visualize the full tree and identify constraints
- Blocker classification: native binaries, API removals, version pins, and mitigation strategies
- Incremental upgrade planning: building a staged path instead of a multi-month freeze
- Identifying and patching unfixable transitive dependencies using patch files and monkeypatching
- CI/CD integration: testing new runtime versions early without forcing adoption
- Migration workflow: parallel runs, canary deployments, and safe fallback procedures

Download Your EOL Runtime Upgrade Guide now to navigate runtime migrations without dependency hell derailing your project.
