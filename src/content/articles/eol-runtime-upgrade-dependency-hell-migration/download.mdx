Your runtime hits EOL. You need to upgrade. Your code is compatible, direct dependencies support the new version, but a transitive dependency three levels deep pins an incompatible package. You're blocked by code you don't own and never reviewed. The blocker isn't your code—it's packages you don't directly call, native modules in transitive dependencies, and build tooling expecting older ABIs. Longer gaps between versions compound breakage: abandoned libraries, renamed packages, removed APIs, incompatible binaries.

This complete guide teaches you how to escape dependency hell.
