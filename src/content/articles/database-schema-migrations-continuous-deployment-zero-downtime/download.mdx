A migration that takes 200ms on your development dataset locks tables for four minutes against 50 million production rows. During that window, writes queue, connection pools exhaust, timeouts cascade. Rolling deployments mean old and new code run simultaneously—your schema must work with both versions. A migration that fails might leave your database in a state neither version can handle. Schema changes need their own safety patterns, separate from code deployments.

This complete guide teaches you how to automate migrations with zero-downtime.

Read this e-book to understand:

- The lock problem: why DDL operations block all queries and cause cascading timeouts
- The compatibility window: why old and new code must coexist with the same schema during deployments
- Expand-contract pattern: decomposing breaking changes into safe, reversible steps
- Online schema changes: techniques to avoid table locks and rewriting
- Backward-compatible migrations: adding and removing columns safely without breaking code
- Rollback strategies: planning for failure and implementing safe rollback procedures
- Orchestrating migrations in CD pipelines: timing, sequencing, and monitoring
