Rate limiting is a double-edged sword. Done right, it protects systems from overload and abuse. Done wrong, it becomes a self-inflicted outage. A company implemented per-IP rate limiting at 100 requests per minute to prevent scraping, but five hundred employees behind corporate NAT couldn't use the service. After switching to per-key quotas, a viral traffic spike triggered fixed-window boundary problems—90% of requests rejected at minute boundaries. They switched to sliding window counters with token bucket for burst handling. Same spike, smooth distribution, full service capacity.

Rate limiting isn't about saying "no." It's about saying "not yet" while maintaining quality for everyone.
