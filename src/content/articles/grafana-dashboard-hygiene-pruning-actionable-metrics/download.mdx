It's 3 AM and the payments service is down. The on-call engineer searches Grafana for "payments" and finds 47 results: personal experiments from engineers who left years ago, copies of copies, metrics from deprecated versions. Ten minutes into the incident, they still haven't found the authoritative dashboard. Dashboard accumulation isn't anyone's fault—it's natural. Services get dashboards; incidents spawn debug dashboards; teams clone them. Deletion feels risky. Nobody owns them. Stale dashboards mislead during critical moments. Every unused dashboard wastes query capacity on your metrics infrastructure.

This complete guide teaches you how to audit and prune dashboards systematically.
