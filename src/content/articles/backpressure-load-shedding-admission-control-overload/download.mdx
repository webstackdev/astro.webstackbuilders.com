An e-commerce platform's flash sale traffic spiked to 10x normal within minutes. The system accepted every request—that was the problem. Database connections exhausted. Response times climbed from 200ms to 30 seconds. Clients timed out and retried, doubling the load again. What could have been a recoverable 15-minute degradation became a 4-hour outage. The fix wasn't more capacity—it was teaching the system to say "no."

Without explicit overload handling, systems accept work they cannot complete. Queues grow unbounded, latency spikes, timeouts cascade, and client retries compound the problem. Backpressure is the survival mechanism that lets systems handle design capacity reliably and degrade gracefully beyond it.

This complete guide teaches you how to implement backpressure patterns that keep systems responsive under load.

Read this e-book to understand:

- Cascading failure anatomy: how overload feeds retries that compound the problem
- Little's Law and queue growth: why queue depth becomes unbounded when arrivals exceed capacity
- Goodput vs. throughput: why systems can look busy while being useless
- Load shedding and admission control: gracefully rejecting requests when over capacity
- Backpressure signaling: communicating overload across service boundaries (HTTP 503, gRPC flow control)
- Timeout tuning and priority queues: preventing cascades while protecting critical traffic
- Monitoring and real-world case studies: detecting overload early and recovering gracefully
