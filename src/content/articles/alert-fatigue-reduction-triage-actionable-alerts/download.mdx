On-call rotations with high alert volume drain engineers and slow incident response. An audit found one team managing 47 alerts per 24-hour shift—44 required no action, while the real issue went unnoticed in the noise.

This complete guide walks you through the systematic process used to reduce a 200-alert-per-week system to 35 actionable alerts, with a 90% action rate—transforming on-call from a burnout machine into a sustainable feedback loop.
