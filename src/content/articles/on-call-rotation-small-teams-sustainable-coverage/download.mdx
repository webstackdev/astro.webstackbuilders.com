Large organizations spread on-call across dozens of engineers with follow-the-sun coverage and dedicated incident commanders. A three-person team has none of that. One person on call for a week means one-third of the team is degraded. A team copying enterprise on-call from their previous company saw all three burned out within two months: one person got 47 pages in a single week, mostly transient issues that resolved themselves. After rebuilding with daily rotations, aggressive alert suppression, and no non-critical pages outside business hours, pages dropped to 2-3 per week and the team started sleeping again.

Small team on-call requires ruthless prioritization: not everything is a 3 AM problem.

This complete guide teaches you:

- Rotation design: weekly vs. daily vs. business-hours-only tradeoffs
- Coverage gaps: handling vacations, illness, and absences without burning out remaining team
- Alert severity levels: P1 through P4 and their page policies
- Signal-to-noise ratio: measuring alert quality and eliminating noise
- On-call runbooks and escalation: knowing when to involve the team
- Incident response for small teams: documentation over tribal knowledge
- Compensation and burnout prevention: time-off policies and sustainable coverage
- Monitoring handoffs and context loss across rotation boundaries
