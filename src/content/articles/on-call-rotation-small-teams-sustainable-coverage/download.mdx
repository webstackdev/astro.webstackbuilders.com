Large organizations spread on-call across dozens of engineers with follow-the-sun coverage and dedicated incident commanders. A three-person team has none of that. One person on call for a week means one-third of the team is degraded. A team copying enterprise on-call from their previous company saw all three burned out within two months: one person got 47 pages in a single week, mostly transient issues that resolved themselves. After rebuilding with daily rotations, aggressive alert suppression, and no non-critical pages outside business hours, pages dropped to 2-3 per week and the team started sleeping again.

Small team on-call requires ruthless prioritization: not everything is a 3 AM problem.
