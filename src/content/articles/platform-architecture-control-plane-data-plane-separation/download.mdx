Networking separates routers into control planes (routing decisions) and data planes (packet flow). Platform engineering borrowed this pattern to solve the same scaling problem. The control plane handles configuration, policy, and orchestration—changing slowly with low request volume. The data plane runs actual work—containers executing, traffic flowing, databases serving queries. Coupling them prevents both from scaling. A platform team grew from initial single-cluster deployment to 50 teams with 500 services. Control plane upgrades required maintenance windows, surges in deployment activity slowed the API server, and controller bugs crashed reconciliation for all tenants. After refactoring to dedicated control and data planes, upgrades happened independently, issues isolated, and each plane scaled per its needs.

Design separation into abstractions from the start, even if you deploy together initially.
