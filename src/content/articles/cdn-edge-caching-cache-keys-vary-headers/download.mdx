A CDN misconfiguration allowed a user's personalized dashboard to be cached and served to thousands of other users. The cache hit ratio looked fantastic—94% of requests served from edge—until support tickets started arriving with users seeing each other's private data. The problem: caching returned personalized content without realizing it couldn't be shared.

Edge caching is a correctness problem first, performance problem second. Aggressive caching dramatically improves performance and reduces origin load, but incorrect configuration serves wrong content to users—sometimes catastrophically.

This complete guide teaches you how to design cache keys and responses that enable aggressive caching without correctness bugs.
