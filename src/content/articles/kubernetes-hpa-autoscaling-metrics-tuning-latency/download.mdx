An e-commerce team configures HPA with 50% CPU target. During a flash sale, traffic spikes 10x in 30 seconds. HPA takes 15 seconds detecting load, 15 seconds for controller sync, then stabilization kicks in. Meanwhile, pods need scheduling, image pulls, and readiness probes. By the time capacity is ready—3+ minutes later—users have already left. HPA is reactive, not predictive. By the time it decides to scale, your workload is already stressed. Tuning HPA means minimizing reaction time while avoiding oscillation—a balance requiring understanding traffic patterns and configuring stabilization.

This complete guide teaches you how to tune HPA for your workload.
