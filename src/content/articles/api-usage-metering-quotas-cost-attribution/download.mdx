A finance director lost his mind during budget review: infrastructure costs doubled but when asked why, engineering had no answer. The real problem—one internal team consuming 80% of an API's capacity while costs were split evenly across six teams. Their allocated budget: $15,000. Their actual cost: $120,000. The other five teams were subsidizing them, and nobody knew.

Without usage metering, you're flying blind on capacity planning, pricing decisions, and cost allocation. You can't manage API costs you don't measure.

This complete guide walks you through building cost visibility into your API infrastructure and implementing billing models that scale with usage.
