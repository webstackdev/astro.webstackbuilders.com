A finance director lost his mind during budget review: infrastructure costs doubled but when asked why, engineering had no answer. The real problem—one internal team consuming 80% of an API's capacity while costs were split evenly across six teams. Their allocated budget: $15,000. Their actual cost: $120,000. The other five teams were subsidizing them, and nobody knew.

Without usage metering, you're flying blind on capacity planning, pricing decisions, and cost allocation. You can't manage API costs you don't measure.

This complete guide walks you through building cost visibility into your API infrastructure and implementing billing models that scale with usage.

Read this e-book to understand:

- Metering architecture: synchronous vs. asynchronous tracking
- What dimensions to capture (request count, data transfer, compute time, storage, features)
- Quota enforcement strategies with graceful degradation
- Chargebacks to internal teams and external customers
- Rate limiting models (token bucket, leaky bucket, adaptive)
- Billing system integration and cost reconciliation
- Pricing models (per-request, per-GB, tiered, usage-based)
- Cost allocation between shared infrastructure and teams
- Real-world examples of cost surprises discovered through metering
- Tools and patterns for building metering without custom development

Download Your API Cost Management Guide now to implement usage tracking that supports capacity planning, pricing, and accountability.
