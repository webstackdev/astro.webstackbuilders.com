At 3 AM tracing a user request through twelve services, you discover one logs `user_id=12345`, another logs `{"user":"12345"}`, and a third uses `customer_id` instead. Same user, three different patterns—your queries miss the third service entirely. JSON format isn't the same as a log schema. Without a shared contract across services, you've replaced unstructured text chaos with incompatible JSON structures.
