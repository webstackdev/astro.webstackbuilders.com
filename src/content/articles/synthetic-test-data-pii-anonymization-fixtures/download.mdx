Three weeks into a new engagement, 47,000 real customer records—names, emails, phone numbers, addresses—sat in the staging database. The team's rationale was simple: "We needed realistic data." But staging environments get breached. Security groups get misconfigured. Contractors rotate in and out. Compliance doesn't care about intent; it cares that customer data ended up in a non-production system.
