Three weeks into a new engagement, 47,000 real customer records—names, emails, phone numbers, addresses—sat in the staging database. The team's rationale was simple: "We needed realistic data." But staging environments get breached. Security groups get misconfigured. Contractors rotate in and out. Compliance doesn't care about intent; it cares that customer data ended up in a non-production system.

This complete guide teaches you:

- Understanding the production data trap and why "it's just staging" is not a risk mitigation strategy
- Legal implications: GDPR purpose limitation, HIPAA PHI de-identification, PCI DSS non-production rules
- Discovering implicit schema relationships from production databases using naming conventions
- Validating referential integrity to understand which relationships actually enforce constraints
- Generating synthetic data in topological order to respect foreign key dependencies
- Faker-based fixture generation with reproducible seeding for consistent test data
- Building fixture registries to track generated records and ensure referential validity
