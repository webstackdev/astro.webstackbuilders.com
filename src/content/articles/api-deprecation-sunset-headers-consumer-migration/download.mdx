API deprecation looks simple on paper: announce a sunset date, send emails, flip the switch. In practice, deprecated endpoints live forever. Consumers ignore warnings, sunset dates slip, and enterprise customers have contracts that guarantee availability. One API marked "deprecated" two years prior was still handling 30% of production traffic—and nobody wanted to be the engineer who broke their integration.

This complete guide walks you through the full deprecation lifecycle and the organizational coordination needed to actually remove APIs instead of just wishing they would go away.
