A platform team built an internal developer portal with self-service infrastructure provisioning, then faced the measurement gap: easy to fund when novel, hard to justify when mature. Leadership asked: "Did we save money? Are developers faster?" The team measured platform activity (500 developers onboarded, 10,000 API calls, 99.9% uptime) but couldn't answer what really mattered. The pivot was friction-focused metrics—time to first deployment dropped from 2 weeks to 2 hours, infrastructure tickets per developer dropped 80%, developer NPS rose from -20 to +45. The narrative became clear: "Developers are 10x faster and need 80% less support."

Meaningful platform metrics answer one question: is the platform making developers more productive?

This complete guide teaches you:

- Lead time metrics: time to first deployment, service creation, and deployment lead time
- Friction metrics: ticket volume, self-service rate, and cognitive load
- Reliability indicators: failed deployments, rollback frequency, and mean time to recovery
- Developer satisfaction: NPS, CSAT, and qualitative feedback
- DORA framework: deployment frequency and industry benchmarks
- Observability for platform metrics: measuring from systems and surveys
- Comparative analysis: tracking improvement over time
- Communicating platform value to leadership and stakeholders
