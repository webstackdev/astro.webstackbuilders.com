Your on-call engineer gets paged at 2 AM for high CPU, investigates for 20 minutes, finds nothing wrong, and learns to ignore the pager. By the time a real incident fires—elevated API error rates—they've been trained by false alarms to assume it's another false positive. When everything alerts, nothing alerts. The alerting system becomes noise that hides real incidents.
