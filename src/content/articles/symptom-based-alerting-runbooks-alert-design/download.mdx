Your on-call engineer gets paged at 2 AM for high CPU, investigates for 20 minutes, finds nothing wrong, and learns to ignore the pager. By the time a real incident fires—elevated API error rates—they've been trained by false alarms to assume it's another false positive. When everything alerts, nothing alerts. The alerting system becomes noise that hides real incidents.

This complete guide teaches you:

- Distinguishing symptoms (actual user impact) from causes (potential problems) in alert design
- SLO-derived burn rate alerting to page on error budget exhaustion, not absolute metrics
- Multi-window alerting strategies to reduce false positives while catching real incidents
- Golden signals framework (latency, traffic, errors, saturation) for alert candidate selection
- Runbook design that enables on-call engineers to respond confidently and quickly
- Alert hygiene practices: retirement, deduplication, and reducing actionable rate metrics
- Absence alerts to detect when monitoring itself fails or goes stale
