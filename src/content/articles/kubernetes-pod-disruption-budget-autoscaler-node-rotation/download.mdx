A PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) limits how many pods can be down simultaneously during voluntary disruptions—node drains, upgrades, autoscaler scale-downs. Poorly configured PDBs create deadlocks: overly strict budgets block node rotations, prevent security patches, and freeze the cluster autoscaler. A platform team scheduling node rotation for security patches found half their nodes stuck in "draining" state. A critical service with `minAvailable: 3` and 3 replicas had all pods on nodes scheduled for rotation. The PDB meant to protect availability was now preventing the security patches that protect it.

A PDB is a contract between workload owners and cluster operators. The terms must balance protection with operational necessity.

This complete guide teaches you:

- How PDBs work: the eviction flow and disruption allowed calculation
- minAvailable vs maxUnavailable: choosing the right mode for your workload
- PDB math with percentages: scaling behavior and edge cases
- Autoscaler deadlocks: why strict PDBs can freeze cluster operations
- Designing PDBs for stateless versus stateful workloads
- Multi-zone pod spreading with topology constraints
- Gradual eviction: drain strategies and disruption propagation
- Observability: detecting PDB violations and disruption blocking
