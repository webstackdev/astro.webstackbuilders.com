A team aggressively cached everything and cut 45-minute builds down to 8 minutes. Three weeks later, a security patch landed in a transitive dependency. They ran `npm audit fix` but the cache key only hashed `package-lock.json`—which didn't change because the patch was already in the allowed semver range. The cache hit and restored the old, vulnerable version. The vulnerability made it to production.

CI caching is an optimization that trades correctness guarantees for speed. Every cache hit assumes the cached artifact is identical to what a fresh build would produce. When that assumption is wrong, you're shipping artifacts that don't match your source code.

This complete guide teaches you how to implement caching that speeds up builds without breaking them.
