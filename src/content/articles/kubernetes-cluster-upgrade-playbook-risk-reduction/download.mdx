A team avoided upgrades for 18 months. When forced to upgrade for compliance, they faced a five-version jump. Deprecated APIs were everywhere. Custom controllers broke. Workloads failed unexpectedly. A four-hour maintenance window became a three-week crisis with weekend war rooms. The riskiest upgrade is the one you've been avoiding. Each skipped version accumulates debt: deprecated APIs, changed behaviors, incompatible add-ons. Frequent, incremental upgrades are less risky than infrequent large jumps. The goal is to make upgrades boring.

This complete guide teaches you how to upgrade Kubernetes safely and predictably.
