A 50-developer team with 40 open PRs spawns 40 duplicate full stacks. Most sit idle after the first hour. Databases keep running. Load balancers keep running. By month three, preview environments cost more than production. The problem isn't one environment—it's 50 forgotten ones accumulating charges. Databases and persistent storage are scariest to delete, so teams add retention policies that keep them alive long after PRs merge. The marginal cost of one environment is negligible; the compound cost of orphaned resources is a budget emergency.

This complete guide teaches you how to make preview environments sustainable.
