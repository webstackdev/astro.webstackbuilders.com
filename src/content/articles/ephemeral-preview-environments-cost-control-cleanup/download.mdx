A 50-developer team with 40 open PRs spawns 40 duplicate full stacks. Most sit idle after the first hour. Databases keep running. Load balancers keep running. By month three, preview environments cost more than production. The problem isn't one environment—it's 50 forgotten ones accumulating charges. Databases and persistent storage are scariest to delete, so teams add retention policies that keep them alive long after PRs merge. The marginal cost of one environment is negligible; the compound cost of orphaned resources is a budget emergency.

This complete guide teaches you how to make preview environments sustainable.

Read this e-book to understand:

- Environment lifecycle states: when costs accumulate (the idle state) and what cleanup triggers matter most
- Resource cost and cleanup difficulty matrix: why databases and storage are highest risk, containers are easiest
- Architecture choices: dedicated vs. shared infrastructure and resource sizing for cost control
- Provisioning automation and templates: encoding cost controls and lifecycle policies as defaults
- TTL enforcement and cleanup automation: preventing orphaned resources through time-based expiration
- Cost visibility and attribution: showing developers what their PR environments actually cost
- Hibernation and scaling strategies: reducing costs on idle environments without destroying them
