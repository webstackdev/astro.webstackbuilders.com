A startup was spending 40% of their infrastructure budget chasing 99.99% availability with multi-region failover and 24/7 on-call rotations burning out their team. Their revenue loss from downtime was roughly $15,000 annually. They were spending $150,000 to save $15,000—meanwhile competitors shipped features faster by not over-engineering their infrastructure.

Availability targeting becomes a badge of engineering honor rather than an economic decision. Every additional nine costs roughly 10x more than the previous one. Before committing to a target, you need to know exactly what you're buying and whether the business value justifies the investment.

This complete guide provides the cost-benefit framework for making informed availability decisions rather than chasing prestigious numbers.

Read this e-book to understand:

- What availability percentages mean: concrete downtime hours and composite availability math
- Cost scaling: why each additional nine costs roughly 10x more than the previous one
- Infrastructure, operational, and team burden costs at different targets
- SLOs, SLAs, and SLIs: defining objectives, agreements, and indicators that matter
- Serial vs. parallel redundancy: different cost profiles and diminishing returns
- Risk-based targeting: finding your actual economic crossover point, not prestigious numbers
- Real-world case studies: where money is wasted on extreme availability and where it's essential

Download Your Availability Targets Cost-Benefit Guide now to make data-driven availability decisions instead of chasing impressive numbers.
