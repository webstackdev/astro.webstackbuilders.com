A team spent six months implementing canary deployments because it seemed like the mature choice. Then they hit their first schema migration and realized canary couldn't help. They needed expand-contract migrations and feature flags. Blue/green with feature flags would have given them instant rollback, pre-production validation, and gradual feature exposure without the complexity.

Sophisticated isn't always better. The right deployment strategy depends on your actual constraints: state management, traffic control capabilities, rollback requirements, and operational maturity.

This complete guide helps you choose the right deployment strategy instead of adopting complexity you don't need.

Read this e-book to understand:

- The deployment spectrum: recreate, rolling, blue/green, canary, progressive, and their tradeoffs
- Blue/green vs. canary: instant rollback and pre-production validation vs. gradual traffic shifting
- Resource costs and infrastructure requirements: multi-region failover and traffic management
- Database migrations and backward compatibility: constraints that matter more than your deployment strategy
- Stateless vs. stateful workloads: different requirements for long-running connections and data consistency
- Feature flags as an orthogonal concern: how to decouple deployment from feature exposure
- Decision framework: choosing the right strategy based on your actual constraints and maturity level

Download Your Deployment Strategies Comparison Guide now to choose the right strategy based on your actual constraints instead of perceived sophistication.
