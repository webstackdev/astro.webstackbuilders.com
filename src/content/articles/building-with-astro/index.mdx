## Introduction

Astro is a modern static site builder that delivers lightning-fast performance by shipping zero JavaScript by default. This guide will help you get started with Astro and understand its core concepts.

## Why Choose Astro?

Astro offers several advantages for building content-focused websites:

- **Zero JavaScript by Default**: Only ship the JavaScript you need
- **Framework Agnostic**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or any framework
- **Built-in Optimizations**: Automatic image optimization, CSS bundling, and more
- **Island Architecture**: Interactive components load independently

## Getting Started

To create a new Astro project, run:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

Follow the prompts to set up your project with your preferred configuration.

## Project Structure

A typical Astro project structure looks like this:

```bash
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
└── astro.config.mjs
```

## Creating Your First Page

Pages in Astro are created in the `src/pages` directory. Here's a simple example:

```astro
---
const title = "My First Astro Page"
---

<html>
  <head>
    <title>{title}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Astro!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Conclusion

Astro provides a powerful foundation for building fast, modern websites. Its component-based architecture and performance optimizations make it an excellent choice for content-focused sites.

## Cover Image Prompts

### Prompt 1: Rocket Ship Made of Web Components
Stylized illustration of a sleek rocket ship assembled from modular UI components—buttons, cards, navigation bars forming the hull and fins. The rocket launches upward leaving a trail of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript symbols. Clean, modern tech aesthetic with purple and orange gradient background.

### Prompt 2: Island Architecture Visualization
Aerial view of a tropical ocean with scattered islands, each island glowing with different colors representing different frameworks (React blue, Vue green, Svelte orange). The islands are connected by subtle dotted lines showing interoperability. The water between islands is calm and minimal, representing zero JavaScript by default.

### Prompt 3: Speed Benchmark Abstract
Abstract data visualization showing a performance graph with Astro's line dramatically outperforming others—rendered as light trails or motion blur. The fastest line (Astro) is crisp and bright while slower alternatives fade into blur. Dark background with neon accents, futuristic dashboard aesthetic.

### Prompt 4: Static Site Generator Assembly Line
Isometric illustration of a factory assembly line where raw content (markdown files, images) enters one end and polished, optimized web pages emerge from the other. Robotic arms represent build optimizations—image compression, CSS bundling, HTML minification. Clean, playful industrial design.

### Prompt 5: Constellation of Web Technologies
Cosmic scene showing Astro as a central bright star with orbiting planets representing React, Vue, Svelte, and other frameworks. Connecting lines form constellation patterns. The composition suggests harmony and integration. Deep space background with nebula colors in purple and blue.
