Platform teams want standardization for maintainability and security. Product teams want autonomy to move fast. Mandates breed workarounds. When developers can't use the standard path for legitimate reasons and have no sanctioned escape hatch, they build shadow infrastructure. You end up with less standardization than if you'd designed for autonomy. Golden paths offer a middle ground: curated, supported ways to accomplish common tasks where the platform makes the right thing easy, but doesn't forbid alternatives. Paved roads, not walled gardens.

This complete guide teaches you how to design golden paths that teams actually use.
