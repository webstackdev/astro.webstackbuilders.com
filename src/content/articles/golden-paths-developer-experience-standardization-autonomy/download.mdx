Platform teams want standardization for maintainability and security. Product teams want autonomy to move fast. Mandates breed workarounds. When developers can't use the standard path for legitimate reasons and have no sanctioned escape hatch, they build shadow infrastructure. You end up with less standardization than if you'd designed for autonomy. Golden paths offer a middle ground: curated, supported ways to accomplish common tasks where the platform makes the right thing easy, but doesn't forbid alternatives. Paved roads, not walled gardens.

This complete guide teaches you how to design golden paths that teams actually use.

Read this e-book to understand:

- What makes a path "golden": opinionated defaults, active maintenance, and demonstrable advantages
- The autonomy spectrum: mandates for compliance, golden paths for common patterns, self-service for innovation
- Anti-patterns that kill paths: golden handcuffs (no escape), golden cobwebs (unmaintained), golden labyrinth (too many choices)
- Path discovery and decision trees: helping developers find the right path without cognitive overload
- Entrypoints and journey design: making the common case trivial to adopt
- Extension points and escape hatches: enabling legitimate edge cases without abandoning standardization
- Measuring path health: adoption rates, team velocity, and feedback loops that improve paths over time

Download Your Golden Paths Guide now to build developer experience that scales with your platform without stifling autonomy.
