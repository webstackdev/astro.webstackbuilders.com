A team running 50 nodes never checked actual resource utilization. When examined, CPU averaged 15% and memory 25%. Requests were 3-4x what workloads used. Right-sizing requests dropped them to 20 nodes—a 60% cost reduction with zero performance impact. Workloads didn't notice because they never used the resources they'd requested. Compute is 60-80% of Kubernetes spend, yet most teams have no visibility into whether requests match actual usage. Developers request "enough" with padding. Clusters run at 20-30% utilization while paying for 100%.

This complete guide teaches you how to eliminate Kubernetes waste and optimize spend.
