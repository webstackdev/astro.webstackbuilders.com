Terraform modules are contracts. When you publish a module—even internally—you're making promises about inputs, outputs, and behavior. Break those promises carelessly and you break your consumers' infrastructure.

Modules need to evolve as requirements change and you learn better patterns. But improving a module without forcing every consumer to scramble requires intentional interface design: choosing the right defaults, structuring inputs to guide correct usage, and versioning changes so consumers can upgrade on their own timeline.

This complete guide teaches you:

- Understanding module interfaces as five layers: inputs, outputs, resource behavior, provider requirements, and implicit contracts
- Breaking vs non-breaking changes: which modifications require major version bumps and migration paths
- Required vs optional variable design: when to force consumers to decide and when to provide sensible defaults
- Environment-aware defaults using null sentinels and coalesce to vary behavior between production and development
- Complex object variables with optional attributes and nested defaults to improve ergonomics
- Input validation patterns to catch configuration errors at plan time, not apply time
- Semantic versioning discipline for modules: major.minor.patch and how provider changes affect compatibility
