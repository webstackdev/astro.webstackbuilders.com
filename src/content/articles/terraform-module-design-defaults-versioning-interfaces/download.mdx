Terraform modules are contracts. When you publish a module—even internally—you're making promises about inputs, outputs, and behavior. Break those promises carelessly and you break your consumers' infrastructure.

Modules need to evolve as requirements change and you learn better patterns. But improving a module without forcing every consumer to scramble requires intentional interface design: choosing the right defaults, structuring inputs to guide correct usage, and versioning changes so consumers can upgrade on their own timeline.

This complete guide teaches you:
