A platform team shipped a "small cleanup": renamed a field, removed an endpoint, updated the response format. No version bump. No deprecation notice. Friday afternoon deploy, Slack message nobody read. Monday morning, 40 CI pipelines failed. Three teams scrambled to update scripts. A critical hotfix got blocked. The platform team spent the week doing emergency migrations. Internal APIs deserve more versioning discipline than external ones. Internal customers are captive customers who can't switch platforms. Breaking their workflows with no notice forces them into costly, unplanned work.

This complete guide teaches you how to version internal platform APIs responsibly.
