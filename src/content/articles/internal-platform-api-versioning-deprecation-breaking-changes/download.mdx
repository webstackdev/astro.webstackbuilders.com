A platform team shipped a "small cleanup": renamed a field, removed an endpoint, updated the response format. No version bump. No deprecation notice. Friday afternoon deploy, Slack message nobody read. Monday morning, 40 CI pipelines failed. Three teams scrambled to update scripts. A critical hotfix got blocked. The platform team spent the week doing emergency migrations. Internal APIs deserve more versioning discipline than external ones. Internal customers are captive customers who can't switch platforms. Breaking their workflows with no notice forces them into costly, unplanned work.

This complete guide teaches you how to version internal platform APIs responsibly.

Read this e-book to understand:

- Versioning strategies: URL path versioning, headers, query parameters, and date-based schemes
- Semantic versioning for APIs: major (breaking), minor (additive), patch (fixes) and what each bump means
- Identifying breaking changes: will existing client code still work? The core question that determines version bumps
- Deprecation policies: 90-day notice periods, sunset dates, and support windows for old versions
- Migration assistance: providing SDKs, tools, and documentation to ease consumer updates
- Communication and transparency: how to announce changes, deprecations, and timelines to internal teams
- Automated enforcement: detecting breaking changes in CI and preventing accidental compatibility breaks
