Every inherited CI/CD pipeline contains service account keys created years ago by people who've left. Nobody knows where copies exist or whether they've been rotated. You're stuck wondering whether touching them will break something critical. Workload identity federation offers a way out: instead of managing secrets that can be stolen, workloads prove identity and receive short-lived credentials that expire before misuse becomes possible.

This complete guide teaches you:

- Long-lived key vulnerabilities: proliferation, git history exposure, and the lifecycle of credential compromise
- Workload identity federation architecture: inverting security from distributed secrets to cryptographic assertions
- OIDC token anatomy: issuer, subject, audience claims and how to decode and verify JWT signatures
- Token exchange flow: from OIDC request through signature verification to short-lived cloud credentials
- Attribute mapping and conditions: restricting role assumption based on repository, branch, environment, and workflow
- AWS IAM OIDC configuration: registering GitHub Actions as trusted provider and crafting trust policies
- GCP Workload Identity federation: CEL attribute conditions, service account binding, and multi-cloud patterns
