Most performance benchmarks produce precise numbers that mean nothing. A test hitting an endpoint with 10,000 RPS for 60 seconds is accurate but not useful—it measures behavior under one artificial load, not production traffic. A team's benchmark showed 50,000 RPS with 2ms P99 latency. They deployed to production where 5,000 RPS caused 200ms latency spikes. The benchmark used uniform distribution while production was bursty, hit one endpoint while production hit hundreds, and ran on dedicated hardware while production shared resources. They rebuilt their suite capturing production traffic patterns, matching environment specs, and running long enough for GC to stabilize. Now benchmarks predict production within 15%.

A benchmark is a model of reality. If the model is wrong, the predictions are worthless.
