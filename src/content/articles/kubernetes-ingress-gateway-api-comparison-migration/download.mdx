Kubernetes Ingress has dominated HTTP routing since 2015, but every controller implements different annotations differently—what works on NGINX silently fails on Traefik. Gateway API, launched in 2020 and reaching GA in 2023, solves this with a more expressive, portable design. But complexity comes with a cost. Some teams migrated expecting benefits, only to discover their simple host-based routing worked perfectly with Ingress. Others managing multi-tenant platforms with complex traffic splitting found Gateway API eliminated hacky annotation workarounds and simplified configuration dramatically. The real choice isn't about which is "newer"—it's about your actual routing requirements, team structure, and tooling ecosystem. Ingress isn't deprecated and won't be for 5-10+ years, so evaluate honestly.
