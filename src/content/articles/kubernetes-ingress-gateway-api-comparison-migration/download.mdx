Kubernetes Ingress has dominated HTTP routing since 2015, but every controller implements different annotations differently—what works on NGINX silently fails on Traefik. Gateway API, launched in 2020 and reaching GA in 2023, solves this with a more expressive, portable design. But complexity comes with a cost. Some teams migrated expecting benefits, only to discover their simple host-based routing worked perfectly with Ingress. Others managing multi-tenant platforms with complex traffic splitting found Gateway API eliminated hacky annotation workarounds and simplified configuration dramatically. The real choice isn't about which is "newer"—it's about your actual routing requirements, team structure, and tooling ecosystem. Ingress isn't deprecated and won't be for 5-10+ years, so evaluate honestly.

This complete guide teaches you:

- The flat Ingress model versus layered Gateway API architecture
- Separation of concerns: infrastructure, platform, and application teams
- Traffic splitting, weighted routing, and canary deployments
- Protocol support: HTTP/HTTPS, TCP, UDP, and native gRPC handling
- Cross-namespace routing and delegation patterns
- Migration strategies from Ingress to Gateway API
- Feature comparison matrix and controller support
