## Introduction

Astro is a modern static site builder that delivers lightning-fast performance by shipping zero JavaScript by default. This guide will help you get started with Astro and understand its core concepts.

## Why Choose Astro?

Astro offers several advantages for building content-focused websites:

- **Zero JavaScript by Default**: Only ship the JavaScript you need
- **Framework Agnostic**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or any framework
- **Built-in Optimizations**: Automatic image optimization, CSS bundling, and more
- **Island Architecture**: Interactive components load independently

## Getting Started

To create a new Astro project, run:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

Follow the prompts to set up your project with your preferred configuration.

## Project Structure

A typical Astro project structure looks like this:

```bash
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
└── astro.config.mjs
```

## Creating Your First Page

Pages in Astro are created in the `src/pages` directory. Here's a simple example:

```astro
---
const title = "My First Astro Page"
---

<html>
  <head>
    <title>{title}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Astro!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
