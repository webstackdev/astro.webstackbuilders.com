## Introduction

Astro is a modern static site builder that delivers lightning-fast performance by shipping zero JavaScript by default. This guide will help you get started with Astro and understand its core concepts.

## Why Choose Astro?

Astro offers several advantages for building content-focused websites:

- **Zero JavaScript by Default**: Only ship the JavaScript you need
- **Framework Agnostic**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or any framework

## Getting Started

To create a new Astro project, run:

npm create astro@latest
```

Follow the prompts to set up your project with your preferred configuration.

## Project Structure

A typical Astro project structure looks like this:

  </head>
