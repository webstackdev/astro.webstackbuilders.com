Every monorepo reaches a breaking point: a repository that started with 10 packages and a 5-minute CI pipeline grows to 150 packages with 45-minute PR validation. The instinct is to throw hardware at the problem, but a 200-package monorepo building everything on every commit will always be slow. The real solution is building less—figure out what changed, determine what depends on it, skip everything else. Affected-based builds analyze dependency graphs to identify which packages need rebuilding. Remote caching stores build outputs so identical work never runs twice. Together, they provide order-of-magnitude improvements instead of linear parallelization gains.

Cache hit rates reach 85%, build times drop dramatically, and developers iterate in small increments rather than batching changes.

This complete guide teaches you:

- Dependency graphs: package dependencies, transitive relationships, and rebuild impact
- Affected calculation algorithm: mapping changed files and reverse graph traversal
- Remote caching: shared build artifacts across machines and CI runs
- Cache invalidation: when to rebuild despite existing cache
- Tool comparison: NX, Turborepo, Bazel, and language-specific build systems
- Implementing affected builds: minimum configuration and quick wins
- Cache hit optimization: file hashing, content addressing, and TTL strategies
- Debugging cache misses and unexpected rebuilds
- Security: controlling cache access and artifact validation
