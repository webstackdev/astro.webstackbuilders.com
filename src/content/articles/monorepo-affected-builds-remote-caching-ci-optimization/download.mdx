Every monorepo reaches a breaking point: a repository that started with 10 packages and a 5-minute CI pipeline grows to 150 packages with 45-minute PR validation. The instinct is to throw hardware at the problem, but a 200-package monorepo building everything on every commit will always be slow. The real solution is building less—figure out what changed, determine what depends on it, skip everything else. Affected-based builds analyze dependency graphs to identify which packages need rebuilding. Remote caching stores build outputs so identical work never runs twice. Together, they provide order-of-magnitude improvements instead of linear parallelization gains.

Cache hit rates reach 85%, build times drop dramatically, and developers iterate in small increments rather than batching changes.
