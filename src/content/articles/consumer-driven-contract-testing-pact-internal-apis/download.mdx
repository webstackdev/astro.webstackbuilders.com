A User Service team ships a "minor" change: renaming `userId` to `user_id` in their response payload. They updated the OpenAPI spec. They ran their own tests. Everything passed. Three services broke in production: Order Service, Shipping Service, Analytics Service. Nobody had checked with them. OpenAPI specs drift from implementation. Documentation gets outdated. Manual coordination between teams doesn't scale. By the time you have a handful of services, ensuring API compatibility becomes a coordination nightmare.

Contract testing inverts the problem. Instead of the provider defining what it offers and hoping consumers adapt, consumers define what they need and providers verify they can deliver it. The contract becomes a shared artifact that both sides test against—breaking changes are caught at PR time, not in production.

This complete guide teaches you how to implement consumer-driven contracts for internal APIs.
