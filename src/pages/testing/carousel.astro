      This route exists exclusively for automated testing and manual inspections of the carousel. It
      renders the production carousel component inside a stable shell so tests no longer rely on
      case study content remaining unchanged.

    <p>
      The carousel below sources its items directly from the case studies collection, ensuring it
      exercises the same data pipeline as the public site while remaining isolated from marketing
      layout changes.
