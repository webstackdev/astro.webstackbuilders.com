      This dedicated route hosts the hero computers animation inside a stable shell so automated
      tests can validate pause and play semantics without relying on home page content or layout
      changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animation below uses the same lifecycle controller and accessibility as production,
      ensuring coverage reflects the real user experience.
