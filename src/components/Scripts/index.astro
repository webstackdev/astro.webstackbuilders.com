  {/*
    Example: Scripts that will be executed on first user interaction with the site
    or after a delay (default 5 seconds), whichever occurs first.

    Usage in component scripts:
    import { addDelayedExecutionScripts } from "@lib/utils/delayedLoader"
    import { yourInitFunction } from "./yourModule"
    addDelayedExecutionScripts([yourInitFunction])

    The singleton pattern ensures multiple components can register scripts safely
    without creating duplicate event listeners or race conditions.
