### Prompt 4: The Fair Queue

Create an image of multiple lanes (per-client buckets) merging into a single highway (backend). Each lane has its own gate (rate limit). Cars (requests) queue in their lanes. No single lane can dominate the merge. Style: traffic management, fairness enforcement, multi-tenant queuing, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 5: The Protection Shield

Design an image of a service protected by a shield made of interconnected gates. Each gate has a meter showing capacity. Normal traffic flows through easily.

Style: traffic flow management, checkpoint inspection, controlled passage, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 2: The Safety Net

Design an image of a trapeze performance where safety nets at different heights represent quality gates. The lowest, strongest net (critical tests) catches major falls. Higher, finer nets (advisory gates) catch smaller issues. A performer successfully passes through gaps while dangerous falls are caught. Style: layered safety, proportional protection, graceful failure, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 3: The Water Lock

Illustrate a canal lock system where ships (deployments) pass through sequential chambers (stages). Each chamber has gates that only open when water level (metrics) reaches the right level. Ships progress through safely; those that would flood are held back. Style: staged progression, controlled transit, level validation, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 4: The Quality Funnel

Create an image of a multi-stage filter funnel where code flows through. Early stages (build, lint) have coarse filters catching obvious issues. Later stages (security, performance) have finer filters. Good code flows through; problematic code is caught at appropriate stages. Style: staged filtration, progressive refinement, appropriate granularity, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 5: The Trust Dashboard

Design an image of a control room with multiple screens showing gate status. Most screens show green (passing). One shows yellow (advisory warning). Operators focus on the yellow, investigating before it becomes red. Historical graphs show gate accuracy over time. Style: monitoring center, signal quality, trust calibration, 16:9 aspect ratio.
