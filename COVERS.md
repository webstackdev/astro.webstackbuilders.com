Data flows through the gateway as luminous streams, with each pillar capturing different aspects of the flow. The pillars should be interconnected with subtle light bridges representing correlation. Style: modern tech architecture illustration, dark background with cyan/blue/purple glow effects, isometric perspective, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 2: Request Flow X-Ray

Illustrate an API gateway as a transparent glass structure with a request traveling through it. The request path is illuminated like an X-ray or MRI scan, showing internal components (auth, rate limiting, routing) as the request passes through. Upstream services visible on the other side. Style: medical imaging meets tech visualization, blue monochrome with highlight colors for key components, cross-section view, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 3: Observatory Control Room

Design a stylized observatory/mission control room with multiple screens showing gateway dashboards, trace waterfalls, and log streams. An operator (silhouette) monitors the displays. The central screen shows a request path diagram. Style: retro-futuristic control room aesthetic, dark room with glowing screens, NASA mission control inspiration, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 4: Signal Through Noise

Create an abstract visualization of a clear signal (representing useful observability data) emerging from a chaotic field of noise. The gateway sits at the center, acting as a filter that transforms raw data streams into organized, colored channels (red for metrics, blue for traces, green for logs). Style: data art, abstract flowing forms, dark background with vibrant data streams, motion blur effects, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 5: Connected Spans Constellation
