title: "Alert Fatigue: From 200 Alerts to 5 Pages"

### Prompt 1: Abstract Alert Overload Visualization

Create a dark, moody digital illustration showing a single glowing green signal (representing an actionable alert) emerging clearly from a chaotic storm of hundreds of dim, red and orange notification icons swirling in the background. The composition should convey the concept of signal vs. noise. Style: modern tech illustration, dark background with high contrast lighting, cinematic depth of field, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 2: On-Call Engineer Focus Scene

Illustrate a calm, focused engineer at a minimal workstation with a single clean dashboard showing one alert, contrasted against a ghostly background showing the same engineer overwhelmed by dozens of floating notification windows. Split composition showing before/after. Style: stylized digital art, muted color palette with one accent color (green) for the actionable alert, professional tech aesthetic, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 3: Funnel Filtering Metaphor

Design an abstract visualization of a wide funnel at the top receiving hundreds of small alert icons (mixed colors, chaotic), filtering down through classification layers, with only a handful of clean, distinct alerts emerging at the bottom. Each layer of the funnel should be labeled subtly (Audit, Classify, Aggregate). Style: clean infographic illustration, isometric perspective, tech company brand aesthetic, blue and green color scheme, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 4: Signal Amplification Through Reduction

Create a visual metaphor showing a radar or sonar screen with a single bright, clear ping in the center, surrounded by a faded halo showing where noise used to be. The clear ping should be labeled or styled to suggest it represents a critical, actionable alert. Style: military-tech aesthetic, dark background with green/cyan glow, vintage CRT monitor texture, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 5: The Alert Audit Dashboard

Illustrate a stylized monitoring dashboard showing alert metrics transforming from chaotic (left side: crowded charts, red indicators, overwhelmed UI) to clean (right side: sparse, green indicators, clear hierarchy). The transition should flow naturally across the image. Style: UI/UX focused illustration, modern SaaS aesthetic, subtle gradients, professional color palette, 16:9 aspect ratio.
