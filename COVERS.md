The asymmetric treatment reflects the different risks of under vs. over-provisioning. Style: weighted balance, asymmetric response, risk visualization, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 4: The Traffic Wave

Create an image of a surfer (application) riding a traffic wave. Behind them, a fleet of pods paddles to catch up. Some pods are ready (on surfboards), others are still starting up (in the water). A timer shows the delay between wave rise and pod readiness. Style: surfing metaphor, wave timing, capacity pursuit, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 5: The Oscillation Dampener

Design an image of a sine wave (oscillating HPA) being smoothed by a dampener labeled "Stabilization Window." Without dampening, the wave is chaotic. With dampening, it's smooth but slightly delayed. An engineer adjusts the dampener dial. Style: wave dampening, oscillation control, stability tuning, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 1: The Two Paths Ingress

Create an image of a fork in a road where a traveler (platform engineer) chooses between two paths. One path is labeled "Ingress" (shorter, simpler, well-worn). The other is labeled "Gateway API" (longer, more features along the way, newer pavement). Signposts show what each path offers. Style: crossroads decision, path comparison, feature signposts, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 2: The Layered Cake vs Flat Bread

Design an image comparing two approaches to building: a flat bread (Ingress—simple, single layer) and a layered cake (Gateway API—multiple tiers with different flavors/roles). A baker considers which to make based on the occasion. The cake is more impressive but requires more ingredients. Style: baking metaphor, complexity comparison, appropriate choice, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 3: The Control Tower

Illustrate an air traffic control tower (Gateway) managing multiple runways (listeners) with planes (requests) being directed to different terminals (services). Controllers at different levels (GatewayClass, Gateway, HTTPRoute) have different responsibilities. Compare with a simpler single-runway airport (Ingress). Style: aviation control, layered management, traffic coordination, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 4: The Migration Bridge

Create an image of a bridge being built between two islands: "Ingress Island" (established, smaller) and "Gateway API Island" (newer, larger). Some traffic still uses boats (legacy Ingress), while the bridge (migration path) allows gradual transition. Workers (engineers) build the bridge incrementally. Style: bridge construction, gradual migration, parallel operation, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 5: The Team Handoff

Design an image of a relay race with three runners representing different teams (Infra → Platform → App). The first runner carries a baton labeled "GatewayClass," hands off to "Gateway," who hands off to "HTTPRoute." Compare with a single runner doing everything (Ingress). Style: relay teamwork, role separation, handoff coordination, 16:9 aspect ratio.
