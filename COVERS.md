Labels on the funnel show "Errors," "Slow," "Important Users." Style: industrial processing aesthetic, data flow visualization, metallic and gold tones, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 3: Head and Tail Decision Points

Illustrate a timeline showing a request flowing through services. At the head (start), a dice is rolled for the sampling decision. At the tail (end), a judge evaluates the complete trace. Two parallel paths show the different decision points. Style: timeline diagram, decision tree aesthetic, contrasting colors for head/tail, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 4: The Budget Balance

Create an image of a scale balancing "Observability Value" on one side (represented by magnifying glass, insights) against "Cost" on the other (represented by storage icons, money). A dial labeled "Sample Rate" controls the balance point. Style: balance/scale metaphor, financial aesthetic, equilibrium visualization, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 5: The Haystack Problem

Design an image of a massive haystack (routine traces) with several golden needles (interesting traces) hidden within. A smart detection system with sensors identifies and extracts only the needles without processing the entire haystack. Style: needle in haystack metaphor, agricultural meets technology, warm golden tones, 16:9 aspect ratio.

## eol-runtime-upgrade-dependency-hell-migration

### Prompt 1: The Dependency Maze

Create an image of a developer navigating a complex maze where the walls are made of stacked package boxes labeled with version numbers. Some paths are blocked by red "EOL" barriers. A glowing path through the maze represents the upgrade path. Style: isometric 3D maze, package box aesthetic, red barriers, golden path, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 2: The Iceberg of Dependencies

Design an image of an iceberg where the tip above water shows 3-4 direct dependency boxes, but below the waterline is a massive tangle of hundreds of transitive dependency boxes, some glowing red as blockers. Style: iceberg cross-section, package visualization, blue water tones, red warning highlights, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 3: The Version Timeline

Illustrate a timeline showing runtime versions from EOL (grayed out, crumbling) through current (stable) to future (bright). Applications are shown migrating along the timeline, with some stuck at EOL boundaries. Style: horizontal timeline, version progression, decay-to-renewal gradient, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 4: The Upgrade Surgery

Create an image of a surgical operation where surgeons (developers) are carefully replacing components in a complex system (application). Monitors show dependency graphs, and replacement parts are staged nearby. One surgeon holds up an old component labeled "EOL". Style: medical operating theater, technical precision, clean aesthetic, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 5: Breaking the Chains

Design an image of chains connecting runtime boxes (Node 16, .NET Framework, CentOS 7) to an application, with some chains being cut by bolt cutters, freeing the application to float toward newer runtime boxes above. Style: chain and lock metaphor, breaking free visual, upward movement, 16:9 aspect ratio.

## ephemeral-preview-environments-cost-control-cleanup

### Prompt 1: The Environment Garden

Create an image of a garden with small plant pods (preview environments) sprouting from the ground. A robotic gardener automatically prunes dead plants and waters active ones. Some pods have wilted (expired TTL), while others flourish. A meter shows water (cost) usage. Style: whimsical tech garden, automated gardening robot, lifecycle visualization, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 2: The Cloud Bill Monster

Design an image showing a small developer happily creating preview environments (represented as bubbles), while behind them a shadow grows into a monster made of cloud bills and receipts. A cleanup bot stands guard with a broom, keeping the monster at bay. Style: playful warning illustration, shadow monster aesthetic, balance of creation and cleanup, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 3: The Lifecycle Clock

Illustrate a large clock where each hour represents a stage in the preview environment lifecycle. Environments move around the clock face from "Created" through "Active" to "Idle" to "Destroyed." Some environments try to escape the clock but are caught by cleanup automation. Style: clock face visualization, lifecycle stages as hours, automation as clock mechanism, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 4: The Resource Hotel

Create an image of a hotel where each room is a preview environment. The front desk shows check-in/check-out (TTL), some rooms have "Do Not Disturb" signs (extended TTL), and a cleaning crew systematically cleans empty rooms. A billing counter tallies room charges in real-time. Style: hotel management metaphor, orderly hospitality, visible cost tracking, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Prompt 5: The Hibernation Pods

Design an image of a futuristic facility with rows of hibernation pods. Active environments glow with activity, while hibernated ones are dimmed but intact. When someone approaches a hibernated pod, it begins to wake up with lights activating. A control panel shows power (cost) savings. Style: sci-fi hibernation facility, energy efficiency visualization, wake-on-demand aesthetic, 16:9 aspect ratio.
