# General coding standards

- Always include clear, concise comments for complex functions.
- Add error handling for all network requests.
- Use template literals for string concatenation.
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces).
- Limit lines to 120 characters for better readability.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Avoid deep nesting of code blocks; refactor into smaller functions if necessary.
- Write modular code; separate concerns into different files or modules.
- Include unit tests for all new functions and components.
- Do not leave trailing spaces on lines.
- Do not use run-astro-dev, always use "npm run dev".
