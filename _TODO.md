## Refactor API Endpoints to Astro Actions

### Action / Domain / Responder Pattern

- The action takes HTTP requests (URLs and their methods) and uses that input to interact with the domain, after which it passes the domain's output to one and only one responder.

**Here you define the route and the methods (get, post, put, delete)**

`/actions` or `actions.ts`

- This layer contains the business logic and the persistence logic (e.g., using a repository pattern or similar data mappers). The domain services are responsible for reading from and writing to the database to fulfill business requirements.

`/domain`

- The Domain is an entry point to the domain logic forming the core of the application, modifying state and persistence as needed. This may be a Transaction Script, Service Layer, Application Service, or something similar. The Domain in ADR relates to the whole of the domain objects, all the entities and their relations as a whole

`/entities` or `entities.ts`

- Entities are part of the domain. They represent state and core business rules, but not persistence logic. Defined primarily by its unique identity, rather than its attributes or properties.

- By any name the Domain Payload Object is a specialized Data Transfer Object. A Data Transfer Object is a fine-grained object, providing properties that mirror or at least shadow properties found on the domain objects that they replicate. A Domain Payload Object is a coarse-grained object that transfers whole domain object instances to the client.

`/responders` or `responders.ts`

- The responder builds the entire HTTP response from the domain's output which is given to it by the action. The Responder is responsible solely for formatting the final response (e.g., JSON, HTML) to be sent back to the client.

### Endpoints:

- cron/cleanup-confirmations → GET
- cron/cleanup-dsar-requests → GET
- cron/run-all → GET
- social-card/ → GET

- contact/ → POST (contact form submission) and OPTIONS (CORS pre-flight)
- downloads/submit → POST
- gdpr/consent → POST, GET, DELETE
- gdpr/request-data → POST
- gdpr/export → GET
- gdpr/verify → GET
- health/ → GET
- newsletter/ → POST, OPTIONS
- newsletter/confirm → GET

### Files importing from `astro:db`

- _utils/rateLimit.ts
- _utils/rateLimitStore.ts
- cron/cleanup-confirmations.ts
- cron/cleanup-dsar-requests.ts
- gdpr/_utils/consentStore.ts
- gdpr/_utils/dsarStore.ts
- newsletter/_token.ts

### Cross-endpoint dependencies:

gdpr: Mostly self-contained, but `verify.ts` does import `deleteNewsletterConfirmationsByEmail` from `@pages/api/newsletter/_token` (line 15). That's a direct dependency on the newsletter code.

newsletter: `confirm.ts` pulls `markConsentRecordsVerified` from `@pages/api/gdpr/_utils/consentStore` (line 10) to mark double opt-in consent. That's the reciprocal dependency.

Newsletter hits the gdpr consent endpoint using `recordConsent` in `src/pages/api/_logger/index.ts`.

If we want to make it feel less inconsistent, we could either (a) rename `_logger` to something like `_consentClient` so its purpose is clearer, or (b) move to a microservices architecture and expose a protected `/api/gdpr/verify` endpoint and have newsletter call it over HTTP as well - but that would need additional auth to prevent abuse.

**Affected components:**

- CallToAction/Newsletter
- ContactForm

## Refactor social neworks in Authors collection to Contact collection format

The contact data collection uses an array of social networks, with keys:

```
{
  network: z.string(),
  name: z.string(),
  url: z.string().url(),
  order: z.number(),
}
```

The authors collection is using named entries under a "social" property, like "twitter", "github", etc. This task is to refactor that to use an array like contact data collection. We also need to add a color for the social network icon, or some other approach to setting the color of it while enabling theming.

## Require successful deployment to merge on GitHub

In branch protection / ruleset for main, add this required status check:
Deployment / Deploy Preview to Vercel

## Display a system font until font files load (Lighthouse improvements)

Display a system font until font files load to improve FCP (First Contentful Paint) with `font-display: swap`. Need to make sure that web font doesn't render larger or smaller than the system font fallback to avoid CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) issues.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Pacifico';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: local('Pacifico Regular'), local('Pacifico-Regular'),
    url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/pacifico/v12/FwZY7-Qmy14u9lezJ-6H6MmBp0u-.woff2) format('woff2');
  font-display: swap;
}
```

Preload fonts:

```html
<link rel="preload" as="font" />
```

TTI (Time to Interactive) measures time from when the page is painted until it becomes usefully interactive.
Interactive can only have two in-flight network requests.
