Playwright's Built-in Visual Testing

Playwright has a built-in visual comparison feature using await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot().

How it works: On the first run, Playwright saves a baseline screenshot. Subsequent runs compare the actual screenshot to this baseline, failing the test if there are pixel differences.

Pros: It's free, everything stays local (no third-party services needed), setup is simple, and you retain full control over the baseline images in your repository.

Cons: Browser rendering can be inconsistent across different operating systems and machines, leading to "flaky" tests or false positives. Managing baselines for multiple browsers and resolutions manually can also be challenging at scale.

## Search UI

- Move search box into header. Should be an icon like theme picker and hamburger menu, and spread out when clicked.
- On search results page, center results on page
- Improve indexing and how contents are returned.

## Performance

Implement mitigations in test/e2e/specs/07-performance/PERFORMANCE.md

## Email Templates

Right now we're using string literals to define HTML email templates for site mails. We should use Nunjucks with the rule-checking for valid CSS in HTML emails like we have in the corporate email footer repo.

## Chat bot tying into my phone and email

Vercel AI Gateway, maybe could use for a chatbot:

## Testimonials on mobile

We have E2E errors again testimonials slide on mobile chrome and safari. I think the problem is that we are pausing carousels when part of the carousel is outside of the viewport, and the testimonials are too large to display on mobile without being off viewport.

## Improve print layout by hiding header and footer for articles, add tracking

```typescript
window.addEventListener('beforeprint', (event) => {
  console.log('Before print dialog opens, run this script.')
  // Example: change content or hide elements
  document.getElementById('hide-on-print').style.display = 'none'
})

window.addEventListener('afterprint', (event) => {
  console.log('After print dialog closes, run this script to revert changes.')
  // Example: revert changes
  document.getElementById('hide-on-print').style.display = ''
  // You can also use this event to send an AJAX request to a server for print tracking.
})
```

Or listen for changes:

```typescript
if (window.matchMedia) {
    var mediaQueryList = window.matchMedia('print');
    mediaQueryList.addListener(function(mql) {
        if (mql.matches) {
            // Equivalent to onbeforeprint
            console.log('Entering print mode (before print dialog)');
        } else {
            // Equivalent to onafterprint
            console.log('Exiting print mode (after print dialog)');
        }
    });
}
```

Please analyze the document CONTENT_PLANNING_OPUS.md

Please add a suggested set of tag groups that would be appropriate for the content goals of the site, as described in the document. These are top-level content organization categories like "DevOps". Then, sketch out 30+ article ideas organized by the tag group they most relate to (they can fall under more than one tag group).
