## Astro DB

### Remote vs. local databases

To connect to a hosted remote database, use the --remote flag. This flag enables both readable and writable access to your remote database, allowing you to accept and persist user data in production environments.

ASTRO_DATABASE_FILE must be set in the environment the "astro build" command is called from for it to take effect. When it is set, the Astro framework will ignore the "--remote" flag if it is also set, and use the local database file passed to the ASTRO_DATABASE_FILE environmental variable.

**Q:** Should the value of `ASTRO_DATABASE_FILE` be prefixed with a URL schema, like `file:./db/dev.db`?

**A:** Optional. Astro will resolve a relative path, and add the transport protocol, if necessary.

**Q:** Does the value of `ASTRO_DB_REMOTE_URL` matter when `ASTRO_DATABASE_FILE` is set in the environment?

**A:** Remote database settings are only read when the integration runs in "remote" mode i.e. the `--remote` flag is present or `ASTRO_INTERNAL_TEST_REMOTE` is truthy. Once you set `ASTRO_DATABASE_FILE `and run without `--remote`, `ASTRO_DB_REMOTE_URL` has no effect.

**Q:** Is the value of `ASTRO_DB_APP_TOKEN` relevant when using a local database file?

**A:** Also only read in the remote mode. When you point Astro at a local SQLite file via `ASTRO_DATABASE_FILE`, the token is unused.

**Q:** Do both `astro build` and `astro dev` use the same mechanism, or work the same way, with respect to the above?

**A:** Both commands share the same integration. During astro:config:setup, Astro decides once whether it's in remote mode and wires either the remote or local Vite plugin.

**Q:** Does the Astro framework create a client for every DB call? Does it create it once on the first access to the DB API, and then reuse the same client for the rest of the execution context?

**A:** During normal request handling, the framework initializes the client once per worker on first access and reuses it for all subsequent DB calls.  When you import anything from `astro:db`, Vite loads the virtual module generated by `vite-plugin-db.js`. The exported `db` token is the return of the `@libsql/client` `createClient` invocation.

When neither `ASTRO_DATABASE_FILE` nor `--remote` is provided, the integration falls back to the constant `DB_PATH` defined in `consts.js`, which is `.astro/content.db`.

libSQL supports both HTTP and WebSockets as the transport protocol for a remote server. It also supports using a local file or an in-memory DB. Those can be configured using the following URL schemes in the connection URL:

- `file`: will use a local file. The host is the path to the file (file:path/to/file.db).
- `libsql`: will use a remote server through the protocol preferred by the library (this might be different across versions). The host is the address of the server (libsql://your.server.io).
- `http:` will use a remote server through HTTP. `https:` can be used to enable a secure connection. The host is the same as for libsql:.

### Endpoints:

- contact/ → POST (contact form submission) and OPTIONS (CORS pre-flight)
- cron/cleanup-confirmations → GET
- cron/cleanup-dsar-requests → GET
- cron/ping-integrations → GET
- cron/run-all → GET
- downloads/submit → POST
- gdpr/consent → POST, GET, DELETE
- gdpr/request-data → POST
- gdpr/export → GET
- gdpr/verify → GET
- health/ → GET
- newsletter/ → POST, OPTIONS
- newsletter/confirm → GET
- social-card/ → GET

### Files importing from `astro:db`

- _utils/rateLimit.ts
- _utils/rateLimitStore.ts
- cron/cleanup-confirmations.ts
- cron/cleanup-dsar-requests.ts
- cron/ping-integrations.ts
- gdpr/_utils/consentStore.ts
- gdpr/_utils/dsarStore.ts
- newsletter/_token.ts

### Cross-endpoint dependencies:

gdpr: Mostly self-contained, but `verify.ts` does import `deleteNewsletterConfirmationsByEmail` from `@pages/api/newsletter/_token` (line 15). That's a direct dependency on the newsletter code.

newsletter: `confirm.ts` pulls `markConsentRecordsVerified` from `@pages/api/gdpr/_utils/consentStore` (line 10) to mark double opt-in consent. That's the reciprocal dependency.

Newsletter hits the gdpr consent endpoint using `recordConsent` in `src/pages/api/_logger/index.ts`.

If we want to make it feel less inconsistent, we could either (a) rename `_logger` to something like `_consentClient` so its purpose is clearer, or (b) move to a microservices architecture and expose a protected `/api/gdpr/verify` endpoint and have newsletter call it over HTTP as well - but that would need additional auth to prevent abuse.

## Typing client-side API calls and SSR API endpoints

Use Astro Actions

### Shared Types vs Swagger / Keeping Docs in Sync

**Type-only sharing (current approach)**

- Pros: zero extra build tooling, server/client stay aligned as long as both import @pages/api/_contracts.
- Cons: no generated docs/SDKs; discipline is required to keep manual docs current.
- How to enforce: treat the contract files as the single source of truth, add lint rules banning request/response literal types outside _contracts, and add lightweight contract tests that instantiate each type against the endpoint handler (failing if fields diverge).

**Code-first OpenAPI (Zod or TS schemas → OpenAPI)**

- Define schemas in Zod/Valibot (or ts-rest) alongside the endpoint. Generate OpenAPI JSON plus TypeScript types from those schemas. Docs (Swagger UI/Redoc) and any client SDKs come from the generated spec, so they're always in sync.
- Guarantees: CI regenerates the spec and fails when the checked-in artifact is stale; endpoint handlers reuse the same schema for runtime validation, so a mismatch cannot compile.

**Spec-first OpenAPI + Swagger Codegen**

- Maintain an OpenAPI YAML/JSON file as the source of truth, run Swagger Codegen (or openapi-typescript) to produce both server stubs and client SDKs.
- Guarantees: developers edit the spec, run codegen (enforced via a pre-commit/CI task), and the generated server stubs remind you to implement every path/verb. Documentation pages (Swagger UI) are rendered straight from the same spec, so they inherently match the implementation.

## Tags

Can we add a markdown page to explain what each tag is, and use those pages instead of src/content/_tagList.ts to define the tags available?

## Use Confetti on CTA forms

`canvas-confetti`
`https://github.com/catdad/canvas-confetti`
`https://www.kirilv.com/canvas-confetti/`

## Use the Page Visibility API to pause videos, image carousels, and animations

Stop unnecessary processes when the user doesn't see the page or inversely to perform background actions.

## "Add to Calendar" button

## Set up webmentions

Needs to add real API key and test

## SCSS Use clothoid corners with border-radius

`https://onotakehiko.dev/clothoid/`

`SCSS Make sure accent-color or styling for checkboxes/radio button groups is set up. Sets the colour used by checkboxes and radio buttons, as well as range fields and progress indicators. The accent colour is inherited`

```scss
:root{
  accent-color : #696;
}
```

## Refactor modals

Modals should be wrapped in the `<dialog>` element and use programmatic methods to display - `showModal()` to disable the area outside of the modal (handles `esc` keypress natively) and `show()` to allow interaction outside the modal, along with `close()`.

## Add for iOS

Specifying a Launch Screen Image

On iOS, similar to native applications, you can specify a launch screen image that is displayed while your web application launches. This is especially useful when your web application is offline. By default, a screenshot of the web application the last time it was launched is used. To set another startup image, add a link element to the webpage, as in:

```html
<link rel="apple-touch-startup-image" href="/launch.png">
```

## Refactor social neworks in Authors collection to Contact collection format

The contact data collection uses an array of social networks, with keys:

```
{
  network: z.string(),
  name: z.string(),
  url: z.string().url(),
  order: z.number(),
}
```

The authors collection is using named entries under a "social" property, like "twitter", "github", etc. This task is to refactor that to use an array like contact data collection. We also need to add a color for the social network icon, or some other approach to setting the color of it while enabling theming.

We should also make sure the avatar key in the authors collection is being output as a responsive image tag.

## Add Google Maps screenshot (or maps embed) to Contact Page

src/assets/images/map.webp

## Display a system font until font files load (Lighthouse improvements)

Display a system font until font files load to improve FCP (First Contentful Paint) with `font-display: swap`. Need to make sure that web font doesn't render larger or smaller than the system font fallback to avoid CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) issues.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Pacifico';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: local('Pacifico Regular'), local('Pacifico-Regular'),
    url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/pacifico/v12/FwZY7-Qmy14u9lezJ-6H6MmBp0u-.woff2) format('woff2');
  font-display: swap;
}
```

Preload fonts:

```html
<link rel="preload" as="font" />
```

TTI (Time to Interactive) measures time from when the page is painted until it becomes usefully interactive.
Interactive can only have two in-flight network requests.
