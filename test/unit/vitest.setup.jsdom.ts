 * Soft reset for JSDOM environment and globals. Removes side effects from tests,

 *
 * - Removes event listeners added to document and window during tests
 * - Removes keys added to document and window object during tests
 * - Remove attributes on <html> element
 * - Removes all DOM elements
 * - Resets document.documentElement HTML to <head></head><body></body>
 *
 * Suppress console output from JSDOM's browser console outlet to avoid a wall of red
 * error messages in tests that intentionally throw, but allow enabling for debugging.
 *
 * @example add pragma at top of file in a docblock:
 * @jest-environment-options {"JSDOM_QUIET_MODE": false}
 * @jest-environment-options {"something_else": false}
