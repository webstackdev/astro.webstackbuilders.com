# TODO

- Test the remaining gulp tasks to ensure they work properly?
- Look into the TailwindCSS TypeScript error?
- Move on to updating and running the test cases?
- Make the MDX plugins commented out in astro.config.mjs work
- update the package.json scripts files to whatever we actually use
- are we validating front matter?
- src/components/Script/visibility.ts - Only mentioned in TODO comment
- src/components/Script/share-highlight.ts - Only referenced in commented-out import
- src/components/Script/Script/animations/ directory (all files) - Only referenced in commented-out import
- src/components/Footer/index.ts - footerInit() function for dynamic "Hire Me" text
- We deleted some of the social media logic. I think it was designed to create a social media card when an article is shared on x or whatever.
