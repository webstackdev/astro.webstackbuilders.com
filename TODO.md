# TODO

- update the package.json scripts files to whatever we actually use
- are we validating front matter?

- src/components/Script/visibility.ts - Only mentioned in TODO comment
- src/components/Script/share-highlight.ts - Only referenced in commented-out import
- src/components/Script/Script/animations/ directory (all files) - Only referenced in commented-out import
- src/components/Footer/index.ts - footerInit() function for dynamic "Hire Me" text
